Twenty-one years old and unmarried, many people already regard you as an old maid. You could have been married and raising babies by now. You’re not concerned, you want to be a soldier.</p>\n<h2>Who are my family?</h2>\n<p>Your father is Dikel of Rakath, yeoman archer. He is an excellent marksman with the short forest bow, which is in common use across the hundred. He provides military service to Sir Alarn Orteyan, Lord of Yalen in return for his land. He is both farmer and warrior. When you were young he humoured you when you asked, and taught you to shoot the bow and to fight with falchion and shield. Your mother is Nala, she is the best alewife in the village. You have three brothers. Uthber is now nineteen and next year he will carry out the military duties; something you were forbidden from doing. This will allow your father to concentrate on the farm. Dybal is fourteen and cheeky. Hiu is thirteen. You also have a sister, Marila, aged twelve. She likes housework, and playing with dolls, she’s a strange girl in your opinion.</p>\n<h2>Where do I come from?</h2>\n<p>You were born and raised in Yalen, in the Hundred of Asolade, in the Shire of Osel, in the Kingdom of Kaldor. Yalen is a small village of only sixteen families, plus the noble household up at the manor. Yalen lies on the south bank of the mighty river Kald. Your family is one of four free families in the village; the others are the woodcrafter, the hideworker and another yeomen. The remaining residents are peasant farmers, good folk in the main, but tied to the land. The lord of Yalen Manor is Sir Alarn Orteyan. He holds his lands from Clan Doulzarn of Novelim Manor. Sir Alarn is a new lord, he inherited the manor when his father died over the winter. He’s making changes and many local serfs are nervous. You grew up in the village and know everyone by name. You know the road south to Novelim. It is only a thirty minute walk from Yalen to Jedes, the largest settlement in the hundred. You have been many times, usually on market days. You have also been inside Jedes Keep, to attend the services to your goddess, Larani.</p>\n<h2>Who are my friends?</h2>\n<p>You’ve been friends with Gorrys of Lunn since you could walk. He’s a good hunter, tracker and trapper. He set the trap that gave you the scar on your cheek. You set off the trap and it flung a sharp flint when triggered; it narrowly missed your eye. You know that it wasn’t meant for you, but you’ve never told him that you know that he was responsible. It happened more than five years ago, he’s probably long forgotten about it. Gorrys nearly died over the winter. He fell in to the river. A yeomans’ son called Kalas of Delsin and a young Peonian priestess young men, both chilled and feverish, with Gorrys’ parents, and went to the manor to tend the ailing Sir Danard. She returned often to check on them, but left when old Sir Danard died. You’ve grown quite fond of Kalas too, he’s rather good looking, and he’s always nice to you.</p>\n<h2>What can I do?</h2>\n<p>You’ve worked on your fathers’ farm all your life, you know the seasons, the crops and the animals. You’ve helped look after your younger siblings. You can forage for food. You can identify the blazons of all of the nobles of Asolade Hundred, and a few more besides. You can build shelter in the woods. You can identify many tracks, you can take care of your weapons and you’re a good judge of the weather. You can make and fletch arrows and yours fly more true than Gorrys’. You’re quick and accurate with the dagger and reasonably skilled with falchion and shield. Last year you entered the archery contest at Dagrath’s Tourney. You didn’t win, but you scored more than your father and your brother, you were fifth in the contest and reckon yourself to be a good shot. You are young, fit, and sharp eyed.</p>\n<h2>What do I own?</h2>\n<p>You own the clothes that you’re wearing: a dark green kirtle (a sleeved dress falling to below the knees); a light green hood; and brown trousers; all of homespun wool. You also have a well worn leather great coat, hood, calf boots, bracers and gauntlets, all made by Gorrys’ father. You have your bow and arrows and a dagger. Your father has given you his old falchion (a heavy single edged sword); you spent most of last night sharpening it. He also gave you a battered, but serviceable buckler. Your mother has given you six silver pennies, and told you that you’ll always be welcome home, no matter what. A leather pouch tied to your belt contains the six silver pennies you’ve been given and a flint and steel. A rough canvas sack contains your spare clothes, a blue wool tunic and a sleeved, ankle length red wool dress, embroidered around the cuffs by your mother. It also contains a wool blanket.</p>\n<h2>Where am I going?</h2>\n<p>Yesterday Gorrys told you that he was leaving for Jedes, to look for work. Kalas and a friend of his, Harlin are probably going too. You’ve wanted to leave home for some time, so you persuaded your family to let you go. After all, there may be four of you travelling together. There must be more to the world than Yalen.</p>\n<h2>Religion</h2>\n<p>Most people worship gentle Peoni, goddess of healing and agriculture. Almost every village has a chapel to the goddess.</p>\n<p>The nobility, and some yeomen (including your family) worship Larani, goddess of the feudal ideal. There are no temples to Larani in the hundred, you attend the service either at Novelim manor to the south west, or at the chapel within Jedes Keep. The Matakea (priestess) at Novelim is young and inspirational. Larani was a warrior woman. There is no reason why you should not be the same. The Matakea at Jedes is old and chastening. Services take place on the 5th, 15th and 25th of each month. You always attend one, usually two services a month.</p>\n<p>You know little of any other gods: Halea is the wanton goddess of profit, pleasure and luck, worshipped by some merchants and city dwellers. Ilvir is the mystic &amp; craven lord. A god of the old ways and old times. Morgath, Naveh and Agrik are the dark gods. All are evil, following them will damn your eternal soul.</p>\n<h2>ASOLADE HUNDRED</h2>\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>Asolade Hundred is in the south-western corner of the Kingdom of Kaldor. The Kald River forms the northeastern boundary, the Osel river, the southern boundary. The western part of the hundred is mostly flat and fertile farmland, although low hills separate the farmland along the Kald from the Osel river valley. Almost all of the population live and work in this half of the hundred. The twenty-two settlements are mostly manorial villages, similar to your own home village. The largest settlement is Jedes, with its tall and imposing keep. There is a monastery to the south, Bromeleon is the home of the shrine to St. Bromel and contains a large hospital. The monks also maintain a leper colony nearby. There are two mining settlements in the hills, one Orofal, mines copper, the other, Tasinald, is a lead mine. The eastern part of the hundred is heavily forested and sparsely populated.</p>\n<p>Across the Kald river to the North dwell the Kath, fiercely territorial forest dwelling nomadic barbarians. To the north-east lies most of civilised Kaldor. The roads are poor and can be dangerous, but all roads lead to Tashal, the capital, a great city where mad King Miginath rules. To the east lies Daynora Hundred and Hutop Keep, home of the Sheriff of Osel, keeper of the king’s peace. To the south lies the Oselmarch, and the lands of the Pagaelin, men who rape and defile all women, better to die than fall into their clutches. To the west lie the forests of Evael, home of the elves. A mysterious people, they are a legend across much of Hârn. Everyone in Asolade knows someone who knows someone who has seen an elf. But no-one can give a good description.</p>\n<h3>Law</h3>\n<p>The manor lords hold court irregularly, they deal with disputes between the serfs in their village. Most of the manor lords owe fealty to Earl Dariune, a mighty lord who lives in a huge castle in far off Kiban. Constable Shernath Mirdarne, rules Jedes on behalf of the earl. The constable is a powerful man, able to call upon dozens of knights and men-at-arms. As Earl Dariune’s representative in the hundred, he can hold court over his vassals. But he is not above the king’s law.</p>\n<p>The representative of the king’s law within the hundred is the Bailiff of the Hundred, Sir Arrys Maradyne. The hundred court is held in the hundred moot village of Asolade, after which the hundred is named. Serious disputes may reach the sheriff ’s court in Hutop, or even the king.</p>","img":"modules/hm-adv-sos/assets/images/lysha-of-rakath.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GQFkK1Ng8wDWHlCC":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.NPCRFIj4MAO6uM1c"}},"_id":"1AbvbS0vHNrMpIpo"}
{"_id":"6iSsBhoexD6IAIlE","name":"Part One: Arrival","content":"<p>There are three locations where the scenario could begin. They are detailed below. Referees may wish to begin by asking for a weatherlore roll from anyone with the weatherlore skill. Any success may get the characters scurrying for shelter.</p>\n<h2>The Bridge on the River Road</h2>\n<p>If the pre-generated characters are being used, they will meet on the east side of this bridge. Four of them (Gorrys, Harlin, Kalas and Lysha) have entered Jedes from the west, along the River Road. The remaining two (Ondren &amp; Ryssi) have entered from the south via the Gibbets Trail (the Hutop road). Ebasethe Ryssi of Chert knows the other characters and will perform any necessary introductions. She will also tell the characters that she has a message to deliver to the keep. From here, the players may decide to accompany Ryssi to the keep, or to make for the inn.</p>\n<p>In the area just south of the bridge, nearby two women are washing clothes. One is rinsing the clothes in the stream, the other is wringing them on the wringing posts set in the stream edge. The women both cast anxious glances into the sky, gather up their clothes, and hurry off eastwards along the River Road.</p>\n<p>There is a great deal of activity taking place on the Ostlers Common. Eight wagons, six of them covered, are being moved into position at the rear of properties 41 &amp; 42. The operation is being watched by a huge man; he is at least six and a half feet tall and has a bushy salt’n’pepper beard.</p>\n<p>If the players tarry to watch what is going on, they will be caught in a sudden downpour. Heavy showers are common in spring; most folk seek shelter when the downpour begins, knowing that the rain is unlikely to last more than sixty minutes. If the characters stay out in the rain for more than a few minutes they will be soaked to the skin.</p>\n<h2>Shelter</h2>\n<p>From the bridge, the characters can see an inn at the opposite end of the village. The inn sign begins to sway and creak as the wind picks up, moments before the rain arrives. If the players are looking for shelter, they really have only two options. They can go to the inn, or, if they have discussed the message with Ryssi, they could go to the keep to deliver the message.</p>\n<h2>The Fallen Tower Inn</h2>\n<p>The local inn is, traditionally, a good place to start an adventure. Whether or not the pre-generated characters are being used, players may decide to seek shelter from the rain in the inn.</p>\n<p>It is still well before noon when the characters enter the inn. The innkeeper, Jastrin of Dyrl, is busy sweeping the floor when the characters enter. There are no other customers present. Jastrin will greet the characters and ask them what they’d like to drink. There are three barrels chocked behind the bar. Jastrin sells Haniale, the traditional piney, nut brown ale common across Kaldor; Jastrin’s Ale, a dark, mild beer; and Asolade Perry, made from fermented local pears. All three drinks are ¼d per pint. Jastrin will also sell quart jugs for ½d and will provide a plain pottery cup for every drinker.</p>\n<p>Jastrin can tell the characters the news. There is a circus in town, the wagons have just arrived and are beginning to set up on the common. The circus-master has gone to the keep. Also, Jastrin can tell the characters that, unusually, the entire light horse squadron rode out this morning, accompanied by two of the knights. A third knight, and half of the medium footmen left with them. There is obviously something going on, though Jastrin has no idea what.</p>\n<p>If the characters tarry in the inn, waiting for the rain to stop, they will receive a visitor. This visitor, Straken of Ornelt is the Melbrin (Sergeant at Arms) of the Jedes garrison. News of armed strangers travels fast, Straken will want to know who the characters are, and what their business is. If the pre-generated characters are being used, Straken will recognise Gorrys, Kalas and Lysha.</p>\n<p>If the characters tell Straken that they are looking for work, he’ll tell them that he might be able to help them, for a few days at least. He’ll tell the characters that the unexpected arrival of the circus, combined with the fact that much of the garrison is ‘on patrol,’ means that additional men will be needed to keep order at the circus. Straken will not be drawn on where they have gone, or why. Tomorrow’s market day will likely be busier than usual, as the circus master has sent criers to all of the surrounding villages. Straken will say that he cannot, himself, offer work, as any hiring must be done by the guard captain or the constable. Straken will state that he should be able to find them work for at least a tenday if the players will come back to the keep with him, for an interview.</p>\n<h2>Jedes Keep</h2>\n<section class=\"highlight\">\n<p>GUARDS</p>\n<p>The Jedes guards are all equipped as medium foot (for HârnMaster character sheet, see @Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-actors.CimFKVS3nmqoyB1m]{Jedes Guard}). Shift change is at noon. The guard currently on ‘drawbridge’ duty is Lillith of Abrall [Jedes 25].</p>\n</section>\n<p>Whether the characters go straight to Jedes Keep (to deliver the message carried by Ryssi or simply to look for work) or whether they are asked to go to the keep by Straken, the characters should find themselves crossing the castle field in the rain, a little before noon.</p>\n<p>The keep is an impressive building, taller by far than any other building in the Hundred. The castle yard is deserted as the characters hurry across it in the rain. As they approach the drawbridge and the open main gates, the guard on duty will step forward from the shelter of the gate onto the bridge and issue a challenge. When the guard speaks the characters will realise that the heavily build guard is a woman in her early twenties (Lilith of Abrail). She says:</p>\n<p><em>‘State your names and business.’</em></p>\n<p>Simply stating that they have a message for the constable will be sufficient for the guard to escort them into the keep.</p>\n<p>If the characters are accompanied by Straken, the guard will not issue a challenge but will simply step aside and allow the sergeant and the characters into the small hall.</p>\n<h3>The Small Hall</h3>\n<p>Having crossed the drawbridge, the characters pass through a pair of thick, iron bound oak doors, through the keep walls, which are over twelve feet thick, and through a second door. The small hall is a little under twenty feet square and is unfurnished. There are doors on three walls. An arch on the fourth wall leads through to some stone stairs. If the characters are accompanied by Sergeant Straken, he will ask them to wait and will go upstairs. Otherwise, the guard will open the eastern door (the kitchen) and call out ‘visitors for the constable.’ From the noise and smell, the room is obviously a busy kitchen. A servant will be sent up the kitchen stairs to notify the constable.</p>\n<p>The guard in the small hall is Dorrin of Lyne, from Skaist. He will recognise Harlin of Kleve, if he is part of the party. After Straken has left (or after he has spoken to the servants) Dorrin will turn to the characters and say:</p>\n<p><em>’I’ll take your weapons now.’</em></p>\n<p>Dorrin will then move to collect spears, shields, swords and bows from the characters.</p>\n<p>Dorrin has had little company for the past few hours. He is coming to the end of his watch (a four hour shift) as a consequence he will be fairly talkative. Careful questioning will allow the characters to glean some useful information from Dorrin. Referees could role play this exchange, resolve it with a skill roll, or do both.</p>\n<table><caption>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold\">Skill Roll: Rhetoric</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Any character trying to get information from Dorrin should make a Rhetoric Roll. Because Dorrin is keen to talk, there is a + 20% modifier to the roll. Information is cumulative.</p>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width:5em\">Result</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:5em;text-align:center\">CF</td>\n<td>Sorry, I can’t tell you anything, ask the sergeant, or the constable.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:5em;text-align:center\">MF</td>\n<td>This circus has arrived when we’re short handed.

The conversation with Straken is a good way for referees to let the players know about Hârnic etiquette and acceptable social behaviour. Straken will then ask the characters to follow him, and will lead them up the stairs and into the great hall.</p>\n<p>If the pregenerated characters are not being used, referees must use discretion. Any noble or clerical characters will be politely offered hospitality (this will be no more than a pallet in the great hall). Such characters should know to address Sir Shernath as ‘my lord.’ They may, however, simply address the other nobles by name.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GQFkK1Ng8wDWHlCC":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.9pdNjNyqalIdUxI1"}}}

You will be twenty three years old this summer and you have yet to settle down. You could have stayed a peasant farmer, but you wanted more. At fifteen you ran away from home, leaving your family to pay the fines levied for your disappearance. You reached the relative safety of the mines, and joined the Miners Guild.</p>\n<h2>Who are my family?</h2>\n<p>Your father is Marrath of Lemra, peasant farmer in the village of Litchton. He is tied to the land, like the rest of your clan. He provides goods and labour to the manor lord in return for protection. You are the sixth of eight children. Your mother died bearing her ninth child when you were eight years old. The baby, a boy, was stillborn.</p>\n<h2>Where am I from?</h2>\n<p>You were born and raised in Litchton, in the Hundred of Daynora, in the Shire of Osel, in the Kingdom of Kaldor. Litchton is a large and fertile village of thirty five households. From your early childhood you have been involved in farming. At the age of fifteen, you decided that you’d had enough. Your prospects weren’t good, far too many older brothers meant you’d probably be reduced to labouring, never getting your own land. The best solution seemed to be to escape and find a new life as a freeman. So you ran away. Eight years ago, you knew everyone in Litchton by name; you’ve since lost touch.</p>\n<p>You headed west, and soon reached the mine at Tasinald, where you could earn your freedom as a miner. Because of your short stature, you were given the tight spaces to work in. You were renamed ‘Ondren the Eel.’ The work was hard, but you’re very strong for your size. A freeman at last, you worked hard and played hard. You’d take your turn escorting the ore wagons to Jedes, spend your pay on drink, and end up in the arms of Tryssa of Dryt, the local whore. Nine months ago you knew everyone at Tasinald. Then there was a cave-in. You were trapped, both forearms caught in the rubble, the corpse of your friend Taerth lying across your chest. You were like that, alone, conscious and in pain, in the darkness for what seemed like forever. It was actually only half a day. You, and two other survivors were pulled out and taken to the moot hall. Six miners had died. Three Reslava (priestesses) of Peoni, who had been en route to the monastery at Bromeleon looked after the injured. Two lads sent by the guild master to get help had found them on the Gibbet Trail between Hutop and Jedes. The youngest Priestess, Ryssi of Chert, stayed until all three of you had recovered.</p>\n<p>On your first day back at work you got a few yards into the drift, but could go no further. You began to sweat, your legs locked, and you had to be led out. You tried several more times, but you cannot enter a mine. Out of work, you briefly returned to Litchton. Fortunately, the new bailiff was not interested in your former status, but your family had grown and changed over the years. You were tolerated as a guest, but the atmosphere was awkward. You soon realised that you were no great farmer, and that you might outstay your welcome. You travelled to Hutop and managed to find work as a mercenary, so for the late summer and autumn you travelled from Hutop to Oselbridge, taking supplies to the trading post and escorting caravans through Pagaelin lands, you’ve seen some action against the vicious Pagaelin barbarians. Never trust a Pagealin, unless he’s dead. Even then it’s best to spear him to make sure.</p>\n<h2>Who are my friends?</h2>\n<p>You have no close friends. Last night you stayed in the village of Calsite, asking hospitality of the Peonian Priestess to save your meagre funds. You chopped firewood for her until dusk, as payment. When you returned to the chapel you were surprised to see the young Reslava, Ryssi of Chert, was also there. You were also surprised that she recognised you, and remembered your name. Over an evening meal she told you that she has a message for the constable at Jedes, the two of you will be travelling together.</p>\n<h2>What can I do?</h2>\n<p>Born and raised on a farm, you still have a good working knowledge of crops, livestock and the farming seasons. You’ve picked up engineering, mining, wood and metalworking skills from your years at Tasinald and you’ve recently become fairly handy with falchion, shield and spear.</p>\n<h2>What do I own?</h2>\n<p>You own the clothes that you’re wearing: a red wool shirt and blue wool trousers; leather calf boots, a ringmail hauberk and cowl; and a halfhelm with a nasal, made from Kurbul (boiled leather). Your hauberk is spoil of war, scavenged from a mercenary who was killed in a Pagaelin ambush. You carry the standard weapons of a mercenary: a dagger, falchion, spear and round shield. A leather pouch tied to your belt contains your last two silver pennies and a flint and steel.</p>\n<h2>Where am I going?</h2>\n<p>The winter has been a lean time, and the death of the sheriff has left Hutop disorganised. With little honest work to be had, as the snows have melted you made your way to Litchton, where a few presents made your family more hospitable. You, then travelled to Tasinald, where you were offered labouring work. You refused and decided to travel on to Jedes.</p>\n<h2>Religion</h2>\n<p>Most people, including you, worship gentle Peoni, goddess of healing and agriculture. Almost every village has a chapel to the goddess. Her services take place on the 4th, 12th, 20th &amp; 28th of each month. You sometimes attend the service.</p>\n<p>The nobles worship Larani, goddess of the feudal ideal. She is regarded by many as the protector of Peoni. Halea is the wanton goddess of profit, pleasure and luck, she is worshipped by some merchants and city dwellers. Ilvir is the mystic &amp; craven lord. A god of the old ways and old times. Morgath, Naveh and Agrik are the dark gods. All are evil, following them will damn your eternal soul.</p>\n<h2>ASOLADE HUNDRED</h2>\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>Asolade Hundred is in the south-western corner of the Kingdom of Kaldor.

To the east lies Daynora Hundred and Hutop Keep, home of the Sheriff of Osel, keeper of the king’s peace. To the south lies the Oselmarch, and the lands of the Pagaelin. They are vicious, mean and ruthless warriors; cruel and untrustworthy. They show no mercy, and deserve none. To the west lie the forests of Evael, home of the elves.

{"name":"Part Five: At the Circus","content":"<p>The circus consists of fourteen individuals, ten men and four women. All are busy when the characters approach. There are two men busy, hammering large pegs into the ground. The others are unpacking two open wagons with a well-practised routine. When the characters approach the circus, one of these two will approach, a burly man, almost 6’4” tall, he will tell the characters that the circus is closed. He’ll ask them to come back tomorrow for the greatest show they’ve ever seen. He introduces himself as Gomon, the strong man.</p>\n<p>If the characters ask to see the circus master, Gomon will shout for the other man hammering pegs to fetch the boss. After a few minutes, the Circus Master will arrive.</p>\n<p>If the characters simply look around for the burly man seen by Valeran, there appear to be only two real possibilities, Larith and Moden. The others are too short, too tall, or too thin.</p>\n<h2>The Circus Troupe</h2>\n<h3>Rhondoman (Circus Master)</h3>\n<p>Rhondoman the Red is a sleight of hand artist. He is a ‘magician’ in the sense that he can perform tricks. Although he will imply otherwise, he has no arcane knowledge. Of average height and appearance, stout, grey haired, and grey bearded Rhondoman would be lost in a crowd but for his love of garish clothing.</p>\n<p>Rhondoman will be outraged at the suggestion that one of his troupe would have anything do with the death of a local. He will appeal to the characters’ good natures, and ask them to leave his ‘little band of travelling players’ alone. He can be forced to admit that he doesn’t know about everything that was going on, for he was in the keep for much of the morning (as the characters know).</p>\n<h3>Gomon (Strong Man)</h3>\n<p>Gomon is tall, burly and bald. His most noticeable feature is his moustache, which is thick, black, and waxed into an upward curl. Gomon is very strong (Strength 20), but is no fighter and is, in fact rather cowardly.</p>\n<p>Gomon knows that Larith, Moden and Corik were ‘slacking’ when the troupe first arrived. All three were missing for at least 20 minutes, probably longer.</p>\n<h3>Tabaron (Tightrope Walker)</h3>\n<p>Tabaron is a wiry man of a little over average height. In his early forties, he has travelled across Hârn in a number of different troupes. Married for over twenty years, his wife, son, and daughter are all now part of the act.</p>\n<p>Tabaron knows nothing, nor do the rest of his family. They keep to themselves, but were together, all morning, putting up their tightrope, they don’t trust anyone else to do it.</p>\n<p>Tabarra (Acrobat/Juggler)</p>\n<p>Tabarra is Tabaron’s wife. In her late thirties she is rather heavier than she was in her prime, and no longer performs in every part of the act.</p>\n<p>Tabarynna (Acrobat/Tightrope walker)</p>\n<p>Tabarynna is Tabaron’s fifteen-year-old daughter. A slim, plain-featured girl, she basks in the attention she gets when performing. Any man approaching her will be warned off by her brother. She is well aware of her brother’s antics and calls him a hypocrite. Tabarynna also acts as ‘target’ for Corik’s knife throwing act.</p>\n<h3>Toboryth (Acrobat/Juggler)</h3>\n<p>Taboryth is Tabaron’s son, aged eighteen, he is slim agile and supple. Any female under thirty and not hideously ugly is fair game to him. He will attempt to impress and flatter any lady he meets.</p>\n<h3>Koroko (Fool)</h3>\n<p>Koroko has been a fool all of his life. Now in his fifties, he is a short skinny man with wildly curly black hair. Rather shy in normal company, he will pratfall, gurn, gaze into space – anything rather than talk. He only comes alive when people are laughing at him.</p>\n<p>Koroko will whistle, twiddle his thumbs, point at birds, anything other than answer a direct question.</p>\n<h3>Thorrek (Dwarf)</h3>\n<p>‘Thorrek the Mighty’ passes himself off as a Khuzan warrior, a true dwarf from the Kingdom of Azadmere. In fact, he is a midget, born in Tashal. He has never been to Azadmere, although he can speak some Khuzan, as it enhances his act. In the show, Thorrek is also Okorok, the foil of Kokoro.</p>\n<p>Thorrek is probably the cleverest man in the troupe and misses very little of what’s going on. He will first ask the characters if there is a reward for information. If they say yes, he’ll talk immediately, for as little as four pence. If they say no, he may need some persuading. Eventually he will confirm Gomon’s story, that Larith, Moden and Corik were missing for about 20 minutes, maybe longer soon after the troupe arrived. He will also tell the players that Corik and Larith are ‘nasty pieces of work’ and that Moden is ‘simple’. He’ll advise the players to speak to Moden alone.</p>\n<h3>Mylara (Animal Handler)</h3>\n<p>Mylara joined the troupe in Hutop. She owns eight performing birds, six blackbirds and two eagles. She has turned down several offers of employment as a falconer. Her empathy with her birds is remarkable. A short, rather plump woman in her late twenties, Mylara is in fact a Journeyman Fyvrian Shek-Pvar, she uses her act to improve her control over her birds.</p>\n<p>Mylara knows nothing, she has been tending her birds since the troupe arrived.</p>\n<h3>Rhondoma (Magician)</h3>\n<p>Rhondoma is Rhondoman’s assistant and helper. She is also his daughter. Like her father, she is a sleight of hand artist and a fast talker.</p>\n<p>Rhondoma will agree with her father, and beg the characters to leave the troupe alone. They don’t want any trouble.</p>\n<h3>Corik (Knife Thrower)</h3>\n<p>Corik is a knife expert, and is fascinated by sharp things. He is also completely amoral. He will lie, cheat, and steal at any opportunity. He has been with the troupe for a little over six months. A short, slender, and sharp featured man, he smiles only when performing his act.</p>\n<h3>Larith (Animal Handler)</h3>\n<p>Larith owns a trained bear and four performing dogs. A cruel and vindictive man, his animals are afraid of him. He is a burly man a little under 6’ tall.</p>\n<h3>Moden (Labourer)</h3>\n<p>Moden is a burly man, standing 5’ 10” tall. He is naïve, friendly, and assumes that everyone will act for the best. He trusts Laryth implicitly.</p>\n<p> </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GQFkK1Ng8wDWHlCC":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.dTczl5scc4a8SuhG"}},"_id":"GNwS5oyEiNGZ2ABY"}

You are twenty one years old. Last spring you were ordained as an Ebasethe (Priestess of Peoni) of the all female order of the Balm of Joy.</p>\n<h2>Who are my family?</h2>\n<p>Your mother was widowed three years before you were born. You don’t know who your father was, and if your mother does, she has not told you. She remarried two years after you were born, to Farrik of Chert, a freehold farmer. Though you bear his clan name, your step-father always reminded you that you were of clan Chert by his sufferance, not by blood or right. Three years after they married your mother gave birth to your half-brother, Ardin. Your elder half-siblings were fostered with various relatives when their father died. They all belong to clan Arlath. Your childhood might have been unhappy if it had not been for Ebasethe Maris, the local Priestess of Peoni. She took to you and helped you through your early years. She even taught you your letters. In your fourteenth year your stepfather told you that he intended to betroth you to his cousin Halir. Halir was already forty. Horrified, you confided in Ebasethe Maris, and she somehow managed to persuade your stepfather to allow you to train as a priestess.</p>\n<h2>Where do I come from?</h2>\n<p>You were born and raised in Umbatir, in the Hundred of Myaman, in the Shire of Meselyne, in the Kingdom of Kaldor. You lived in Umbatir for the first fourteen years of your life. A small settlement of twenty-one households, you knew everyone. Umbatir lies north east of the road between Olokand and Tashal.</p>\n<p>At fourteen Ebasethe Maris took you to the temple in Tashal, where for the next six years you were trained as a priestess. You lived in the temple, in the Esolani (acolyte) quarters, but took every opportunity to explore the great city of Tashal. Your curiosity has got you into trouble on several occasions. Upon your ordination almost a year and a half ago your curiosity once again got the better of you. You petitioned the temple to be allowed to leave. Your wish was granted. You, together with Ebasethe Garythe were sent to accompany the elderly Ebasethe Yrtha on a pilgrimage. You travelled to her birthplace, Qualdris, before turning west to visit the shrine of Saint Bromel at Bromeleon. Between Hutop and Jedes. You were summoned by a couple of youths to the local mine, where there had been a collapse. Six corpses were pulled from the collapse, and three survivors. You nursed them all back to health. You continued to Bromeleon and then went, with Yrtha, to the leper colony at Poynter. Ebasethe Garythe left, but you remained at Poynter and nursed Yrtha until her death. You spent much of the year in the leper colony at Poynter. As winter began, you left, and went to help an elderly priestess, Bredyth, minister to the village of Novelim. In the middle of winter a guardsman from Yalen arrived, he had been sent for help as the local lord was ill and the local priest had recently died. Bredyth sent you, a sensible decision, as you were younger and fitter. An attractive young yeoman’s son, Kalas of Delsin, was sent with you. You were halfway between Novelim &amp; Yalen when Kalas spotted someone in the river. He waded in and pulled out an unconscious young man. The young man, Gorrys of Lunn, was extremely cold and close to death. After plunging into the river Kalas, too, was freez- ing. The three of you struggled into Yalen in a blizzard. You left the men in the care of Gorrys’ family and went to the manor house. The old lord was weak and feverish. Despite your efforts, he died ten days later. The lord’s son let it be known that you were no longer welcome, so you left for Bromeleon. From Bromeleon you were sent to the sheriff in Hutop, to deliver a message. The sheriff had died and the acting sheriff, a coarse man with little respect for you, read it and them told you to deliver it to the constable at Jedes instead.</p>\n<h2>Who are my friends?</h2>\n<p>You have few true friends. You’ve met several people over your last few months in this part of Kaldor. You’ve decided to travel from settlement to settlement, staying with the resident priests and getting to know the area.</p>\n<h2>What can I do?</h2>\n<p>You’re a farmers daughter and your church encour- ages knowledge of agriculture, you can cook, you have helped lay out corpses, you are literate and can illuminate manuscripts, though not well. You have the basics of several healing skills. You know a little about a lot, law, mathematics, folklore etc.</p>\n<h2>What do I own?</h2>\n<p>You own nothing! The goddess will provide for you. Praise be to Peoni! The church of Peoni provides the clothes that you wear. Your robes are ceremonially changed at the beginning of each season. You currently wear the white robes of winter: you have a long-sleeved ankle length wool robe; a short sleeved thigh length wool over-tunic; a wool hood, and a pair of leather shoes. In a little over ten days you must attend the Turning Cer- emony, to receive the green robes of Spring. You carry a knife, to eat with. You have neither money nor goods, but your calling means that you are guaranteed hospitality in most villages.</p>\n<h2>Where am I going?</h2>\n<p>You are travelling to Jedes, you have a message for the constable. After that, who knows? You are an Ebasethe and should return to your temple in Tashal. However, you’d rather explore this area. If people keep asking you for help, how can you refuse? You can justify your stay for as long as you’re doing the goddess’ work. Last night you stayed in the village of Calsite, asking hospitality of the Peonian Priestess. Ondren of Lemra, one of the miners you nursed was also there. He has offered to escort you to Jedes.</p>\n<h2>Religion</h2>\n<p>Most people worship your goddess, gentle Peoni, god- dess of healing and agriculture. You can be sure of charity and aid from the pious, but the goddess preaches a life of celibacy poverty and service for her clergy. You should take little, and expect little, from the lay worshippers.</p>\n<p>The nobles worship Larani, goddess of the feudal ideal. Most noble lords will treat you respectfully, in most cases this is genuine respect for your calling. All nobles know that a lack of respect for the ‘peasants goddess’ can cre- ate problems.</p>\n<p>Wanton Halea, goddess of selfishness is becoming popular with many merchants and freemen. You should preach against her ways.</p>\n<p>Ilvir the craven lord is followed by some. His follow- ers preach of fate and mysticism, some practice animal sacrifice. His followers should be gently guided to the true path.</p>\n<p>Morgath, Naveh, and Agrik are dark and evil; bringers of death, chaos and destruction. Following them will damn your eternal soul.</p>\n<h2>ASOLADE HUNDRED</h2>\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>Asolade Hundred is in the south-western corner of the Kingdom of Kaldor. The Kald River forms the northeastern boundary, the Osel river, the southern boundary. The western part of the hundred is mostly flat and fertile farmland. The settlements are mostly manorial villages, similar to your own home village. The largest settlement is Jedes, with its tall and imposing keep. There is a monastery to the south, Bromeleon is the home of the shrine to St. Bromel and contains a large hospital. The monks also maintain a leper colony nearby. There are two mining settlements in the hills, one Orofal, mines copper, the other, Tasinald, is a lead mine. The eastern part of the hundred is heavily forested and sparsely populated.</p>\n<p>The roads are poor and can be dangerous, but all roads lead to Tashal, the capital, a great city where wise old King Miginath rules. To the east lies Daynora Hundred and Hutop Keep, home of the Sheriff of Osel, keeper of the king’s peace.</p>\n<h3>Law</h3>\n<p>The manor lords hold court irregularly, they deal with disputes between the serfs in their village. Most of the manor lords owe fealty to Earl Dariune, a mighty lord who lives in a huge castle in far off Kiban. A constable, Sir Shernath Mirdarne, rules Jedes on behalf of the earl. The constable is a powerful man, able to call upon dozens of knights and men-at-arms. As Earl Dariune’s representative in the hundred, he can hold court over his vassals. But he is not above the king’s law.</p>\n<p>The representative of the king’s law within the hundred is the Bailiff of the Hundred. Serious disputes may reach the sheriffs court in Hutop, or even the king.</p>","img":"modules/hm-adv-sos/assets/images/ryssi-of-chert.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GQFkK1Ng8wDWHlCC":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.gjorj70EZs7xdo0U"}},"_id":"K3u82UXQRSdK8rsQ"}
{"name":"Yma the Goose Girl","content":"<p>Yma is the keeps’ goose girl. The characters will soon discover that the constable takes a great deal of interest in his geese. As a consequence the bare-foot and scruffy Yma has a place much higher in the keep hierarchy than either her age or appearance would suggest.</p>\n<p>Referees may wish to allow players an Intrigue roll, with a success allowing them to realise, from the way she is treated by Straken and the keep guards, that she has some indeterminate ‘status’ within the keep.</p>\n<h2>Questioning Yma</h2>\n<p>Referees may make questioning Yma a frustrating business for the characters. She is a young girl and is likely to take questions literally. She will assume that the characters know everyone whom she knows. The sample questions below give a flavour of any interview:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Did you find the body?</p>\n<p>No, Blackeye did, I told Straken, don’t you listen?</p>\n<p>Who is Blackeye?</p>\n<p>My best layer. She ran off, she’s a naughty girl. I followed her here.</p>\n<p>Can you identify the body?</p>\n<p>It’s Felyss.</p>\n<p>Who is Felyss?</p>\n<p>(sigh) Don’t you know anything? Who are you anyway? Why did Straken send you? Where are all the proper guards?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>What Yma Knows</h2>\n<p>Careful questioning will eventually reveal the following information:</p>\n<p>Blackeye is currently Yma’s best layer, a large and aggressive goose with a black patch over her right eye. Yma was looking for the goose, who often strays from the flock, when she found goose and corpse in the grove. She knows the woman, it is Felyss, daughter of one of the local half-villeins, Faran of Kyngens (Jedes [47]).</p>\n<p>When she saw her, she called out her name and then approached. She was a little frightened, but approached close enough to tap her on the shoulder with her goose stick (Yma carries a four foot long willow wand which she uses to herd her geese). When she got no response she ran back to the keep.</p>\n<p>Yma has seen Felyss in the grove before, usually with Meliren of Heriel, the ostler’s son. There are often grown-ups in the grove together, usually in couples.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GQFkK1Ng8wDWHlCC":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.gVGZZLX2LKAS2Ett"}},"_id":"Q8kaYTEDjnyEAzyo"}

You are twenty-one years old and hold guild papers as a journeyman ostler. You have lived with horses all of your life, Who are my family?</p>\n<p>Your father is Farrath of Kleve, free master ostler from the village of Skaist. He breeds and breaks horses, he also stables, grooms, and shoes. Your mother is Sallas, you are the fifth of six children. Your eldest brother, Skort, is ten years your senior. He is married with two young children. Skort is the senior journeyman to your father and there is little doubt that he will eventually inherit the guild franchise. Your eldest sister is Jahna, she ran off with a group of travelling players when she was eighteen. Skort, then twenty, tracked her down, but she refused to return. You’ve heard that Jahna is a fine singer and that the troupe is well respected. They have even played before the king. Gordyn is your next brother, aged twenty-six, he is now a master ostler, bonded to the Bailiff of the Hundred of Asolade. Twenty three year old Vergyl is married and pregnant, she married the village metalsmith, a widower seven years her senior, only last year. Your youngest sister is Alayna; five years your junior.</p>\n<h2>Where am I from?</h2>\n<p>You were born and raised in Skaist, a village of twentytwo households in the Hundred of Asolade, in the Shire of Osel, in the kingdom of Kaldor. Skaist, and another fourteen households, which form the hamlet of Deshines, about a quarter-league away, are ruled by a bailiff from Skaist manor. The Lord Bailiff of Skaist is Sir Garith Kaphin, one of his cousins is the king’s Lord Privy Seal and, rumour has it, mistress. Your family is one of eight free families in the two villages. There are four guild clans, your own, the miller, the metalsmith, and the charcoaler, plus four yeomen. The remaining residents are peasant farmers, good folk in the main, but tied to the land. You grew up in Skaist and lived there until you were fourteen.</p>\n<p>In your fourteenth year your father arranged an apprenticeship for you. You were taken to Novelim, three leagues to the west, where you were introduced to the master ostler Yerick of Ubel. Yerick breeds ponies, mules and donkeys, not fine palfreys like your father. Novelim is about the same size as Skaist, twenty-four households, the manor lord is Sir Terris Doulzarn, one of the wealthiest nobles in the hundred.</p>\n<h2>Who are my friends?</h2>\n<p>You have been in Novelim for seven years, during this time you have become familiar with the village and its inhabitants. You have made a few friends, among them is the adopted son of one of the yeomen, Kalas of Delsin. Kalas is the same age as you, he was trained in arms by his foster-father. Over the years you’ve taught him to read and write. He is fascinated by this skill. In return, he’s helped you with your spear and shield drills. The only time you’ve argued was three years ago, you fell out over Belysa of Marish, the pretty daughter of one of the villeins. You stopped speaking to each other, and both of you spent everything you had buying her presents. Then she got work as a servant in the manorhouse; and married the chamberlain, who was twice her age.</p>\n<p>Last autumn a young Peonian priestess arrived in the village, you got on well with her. Her name was Ryssi of Chert. Almost a month ago she left for Yalen, accompanied by Kalas. She did not return.</p>\n<h2>What can I do?</h2>\n<p>You have few skills, but the ones that you have, you are good at. You can make leather goods, repair saddles and bridles, you are an expert in horses and horse care and you’re a good horse rider.</p>\n<p>Since arriving in Novelim you’ve taken to swimming in the river Kald, while hardly an expert, you can safely splash your way from one side of the river to the other.</p>\n<p>Your father taught you your letters. Your master continued the lessons. You can read and write. Most of what you write is bloodlines for horses. All of the local ostlers keep a careful written record of breeding.</p>\n<p>You’ve been in the militia for seven years. This involves practicing weapon drills with the local yeomen, four times each month. You know which end of a spear is which, but you know that you’re no expert, and you’ve never seen combat.</p>\n<h2>What do I own?</h2>\n<p>You own the clothes that you’re wearing: a good, red dyed cloth shirt; leather riding breeches and calf boots; and a quilt aketon and cowl. You own a dagger plus your ‘militia’ weapons, a spear and a roundshield. You also own a few tools, a shoeing hammer and a horse comb amongst them. You have twelve pennies in coin in a pouch in your belt, and you have a green woollen tunic and brown trousers, your best clothes, in a sack.</p>\n<h2>Where am I going?</h2>\n<p>As a journeyman Ostler you can look for employment with any Master Ostler. Unfortunately, so far as you know, none of the masters within the Hundred are currently looking for staff. Jedes is not a very big place, but it’s the biggest place within a days walk. Tomorrow is market day and there may be work to be had.</p>\n<h2>Religion</h2>\n<p>Most people, including you, worship gentle Peoni, goddess of healing and agriculture. Almost every village has a chapel to the goddess. Her services take place on the 4th, 12th, 20th &amp; 28th of each month. You usually attend the service.</p>\n<p>The nobles worship Larani, goddess of the feudal ideal. She is regarded by many as the protector of Peoni.</p>\n<p>You know a little of any other gods: Halea is the wanton goddess of profit, pleasure and luck, worshipped by some merchants and city dwellers. Ilvir is the mystic &amp; craven lord. A god of the old ways and old times. Morgath, Naveh and Agrik are the dark gods. All are evil, following them will damn your eternal soul.</p>\n<h2>ASOLADE HUNDRED</h2>\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>Asolade Hundred is in the south-western corner of the Kingdom of Kaldor. The Kald River forms the northeastern boundary, the Osel river, the southern boundary. The western part of the hundred is mostly flat and fertile farmland, although low hills separate the farmland along the Kald from the Osel river valley. Almost all of the population live and work in this half of the hundred. The twenty-two settlements are mostly manorial villages, similar to your own home village. The largest settlement is Jedes, with its tall and imposing keep. There is a monastery to the south, Bromeleon is the home of the shrine to St. Bromel and contains a large hospital. The monks also maintain a leper colony nearby. There are two mining settlements in the hills, one Orofal, mines copper, the other, Tasinald, is a lead mine. The eastern part of the hundred is heavily forested and sparsely populated.</p>\n<p>Across the Kald river to the north dwell the Kath, fiercely territorial forest dwelling nomadic barbarians. To the north-east lies most of civilised Kaldor. The roads are poor and can be dangerous, but all roads lead to Tashal, the capital, a great city where decrepit old King Miginath rules. To the east lies Daynora Hundred and Hutop Keep, home of the Sheriff of Osel, keeper of the king’s peace. To the south lies the Oselmarch, and the lands of the Pagaelin, fierce and ruthless half-demon monsters. Everyone knows the stories of their cruelty. To the west lie the forests of Evael, home of the elves. A mysterious people, they are a legend across much of Hârn. Everyone in Asolade knows someone who knows someone who has seen an elf. But no-one can give a good description.</p>\n<h3>Law</h3>\n<p>The manor lords hold court irregularly, they deal with disputes between the serfs in their village. Most of the manor lords owe fealty to Earl Dariune, a mighty lord who lives in a huge castle in far off Kiban. A constable, Sir Shernath Mirdarne, rules Jedes on behalf of the earl. The constable is a powerful man, able to call upon dozens of knights and men-at-arms. As Earl Dariune’s representative in the hundred, he can hold court over his vassals.

You will be twenty two years old this year. You had work at Novelim Manor until early in the winter, when your cousin Blyr returned home with his wife.</p>\n<h2>Who are my family?</h2>\n<p>Your father is Symon of Delsin, a yeoman from the manor of Yeashim, you barely know him. You were his third child, and first son, by Janyth, his first wife. Your mother died birthing you. Soon after your birth you were taken from Yeashim to Novelim and fostered with your Uncle Oldron, and his wife.</p>\n<h2>Where am I from?</h2>\n<p>You were born in Yeashim, in the Hundred of Asolade, in the Shire of Osel, in the Kingdom of Kaldor. You were raised by your Uncle Oldron and Aunt Sheryel. You regard your aunt &amp; uncle as your parents. You have no memories of Yeashim.</p>\n<p>Novelim is an ancient settlement, which currently consists of 24 households. Three of the households are guildsmen: a metalsmith, a miller and an ostler. There are also four yeomen farmers, including your Uncle Oldron, who is the village Beadle. For four years you have worked as a guard in the manorhouse. You have accompanied old Sir Terris and his family on several journeys. Last year you went to the fair at Tashal, the furthest from home you’ve ever been. However, three months ago your cousin/foster brother Blyr returned home married, with a pregnant wife. He had been working at Jedes as a guard, but had left when he married. Under pressure from your family you left Sir Terris’ service to allow Blyr to take the post. You travelled to Jedes, but Blyr’s guard post had been filled. As winter was setting in, you returned home.</p>\n<h2>Who are my friends?</h2>\n<p>Harlin of Kleve is the same age as you. You have known each other since he arrived in the village seven years ago, as an apprentice to the ostler. He taught you to read and write. Your stepfather thinks that the time you’ve spent learning this has been wasted, but you’re sure that it’s a useful skill. In return, you’ve helped Harlin in his spear and shield drills. He’s now better than the rest of the militia, but that’s not saying much. The only time you’ve argued was three years ago, you fell out over Belysa of Marish, the pretty daughter of one of the villeins. You both spent everything you had buying her presents. Then she got work as a servant in the manor house and married the chamberlain, who was twice her age.</p>\n<p>Last autumn a young Peonian priestess named Ryssi of Chert arrived in the village. Over the winter a messenger arrived from Yalen, asking for help. The local priestess sent Ryssi. You needed to get to Jedes to find work, so you volunteered to escort Ryssi to Yalen. En route, you saw a body in the river. You plunged in and hauled him out. It was a hunter named Gorrys of Lunn, he was alive, but barely. Wet, freezing, and caught in the middle of a fierce blizzard; with Ryssi’s help you struggled on to Yalen. You spent almost a month in Gorrys’ fathers house, recuperating. Ryssi and an old monk named Flamal gave you healing herbs &amp; infusions. You owe the Peonians a debt for your recovery.</p>\n<p>While in Yalen you met Lysha of Rakath, an old friend of Gorrys’. A yeoman’s daughter she wants to become a soldier. You’ve seen her shoot, she’s a good archer, and she seems like a practical young woman, you like her.</p>\n<h2>What can I do?</h2>\n<p>You’ve worked on your stepfather’s farm all your life, you know the seasons, the crops and the animals. You can cook and can forage for food. You can identify the blazons of all of the nobles of Asolade Hundred, and a few more besides. You can build shelter in the woods. You can identify many tracks, you can take care of your weapons and you’ve got some basic medical knowledge. You’re skilled with the dagger, spear, shortsword and round shield, and you can shoot a bow. After some struggle, you have learned your letters and can read.</p>\n<h2>What do I own?</h2>\n<p>You own the clothes that you’re wearing: dark blue trousers and a dark green shirt, both of wool; a quilt gambeson and cowl; Leather bracers, gauntlets and knee boots; and a halfhelm with a nasal, made from Kurbul (boiled leather). You own several weapons: a dagger, a short sword, a spear, a short bow with a quiver of twenty arrows, and a round shield. You carry a sack containing a flint and steel, a wool blanket and a red wool tunic. You have three silver pennies in a leather pouch tied to your belt.</p>\n<h2>Where am I going?</h2>\n<p>You tried to find work in Jedes over the winter, but with no success. It is spring and you’ve recovered from the chills of winter. Now that the snows have gone, people are on the move once more. There may be work in Jedes now. Tomorrow is market day, a good time to find work.</p>\n<h2>Religion</h2>\n<p>Most people worship gentle Peoni, goddess of healing and agriculture. The nobility, and some yeomen, including your family, worship Larani, goddess of the feudal ideal. There are no temples to Larani in the hundred, you always attend the service at Novelim Manor, Sir Terris has his own Matakea, for the last two years this has been Fryda Vareth, she is young, pretty and inspirational. Services take place on the 5th, 15th and 25th of each month. You always attend.</p>\n<p>You know little of any other gods: Halea is the wanton goddess of profit, pleasure and luck, worshipped by some merchants and city dwellers. Ilvir is the mystic &amp; craven lord. A god of the old ways and old times. Morgath, Naveh and Agrik are the dark gods. All are evil, following them will damn your eternal soul.</p>\n<h2>ASOLADE HUNDRED</h2>\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>Asolade Hundred is in the south-western corner of the Kingdom of Kaldor. The Kald River forms the northeastern boundary, the Osel river, the southern boundary. The western part of the hundred is mostly flat and fertile farmland, although low hills separate the farmland along the Kald from the Osel river valley. Almost all of the population live and work in this half of the hundred. The twenty-two settlements are mostly manorial villages, similar to your own home village. The largest settlement is Jedes, with its tall and imposing keep. There is a monastery to the south, Bromeleon contains a large hospital. The monks also maintain a leper colony nearby. There are two mining settlements in the hills, one mines copper, the other is a lead mine. The eastern part of the hundred is heavily forested and sparsely populated.</p>\n<p>Across the Kald river to the north dwell the Kath, fiercely territorial forest dwelling nomadic barbarians. To the north-east lies most of civilised Kaldor. The roads are poor and can be dangerous, but all roads lead to Tashal, the capital, a great city where wise old King Miginath rules. To the east lies Daynora Hundred and Hutop Keep, home of the Sheriff of Osel. The sheriff died over the winter, he has not yet been replaced. To the south lies the Oselmarch, where the fierce cannibal Pagaelin dwell. To the west lie the forests of Evael, home of the elves. A mysterious people, they are a legend across much of Hârn. Everyone in Asolade knows someone who knows someone who has seen an elf. But no-one can give a good description.</p>\n<h3>Law</h3>\n<p>The manor lords hold court irregularly, they deal with disputes between the serfs in their village. Most of the manor lords owe fealty to Earl Dariune, a mighty lord who lives in a huge castle in far off Kiban. The constable, Sir Shernath Mirdarne, rules Jedes on behalf of the Earl. The constable is a powerful man, able to call upon dozens of knights and men-at-arms. As Earl Dariune’s representative in the hundred, he can hold court over his vassals. But he is not above the king’s law.</p>\n<p>The representative of the king’s law within the hundred is the Bailiff of the Hundred, Sir Arrys Maradyne. The hundred court is held in the hundred moot village of Asolade, after which the hundred is named. Serious disputes may reach the sheriff ’s court in Hutop, or even the king.</p>","img":"modules/hm-adv-sos/assets/images/kalas-of-delsin.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GQFkK1Ng8wDWHlCC":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.l8ewIE6DyVQ0VjN4"}},"_id":"UWMSOiVfBOhiKMee"}

{"name":"HârnWorld Information","content":"<h2>GLOSSARY</h2>\n<p>For those unfamiliar with HârnWorld, there are a number of terms that may require some explanation. The glossary below explains some of the more common terms and titles players are likely to meet while playing this scenario.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Bailiff</dt>\n<dd>A bailiff is an individual (usually a man, and usually a noble) who manages a manor for the absent owner. In Asolade Hundred, the bailiffs act as manages for the constable at Jedes and, in theory, defer to him. Bailiffs pay a greater proportion of the income from the manor to the constable than do fiefholders. As a consequence, they are not as wealthy.</dd>\n<dt>Bailiff of the Hundred</dt>\n<dd>A noble who acts as the representative of Royal Justice within a hundred; the Hundred Bailiff is a salaried Royal Official. He (it is usually he) dispenses the lowest level of Royal Justice and is charged with keeping the King’s Peace.</dd>\n<dt>Beadle</dt>\n<dd>The village Beadle is a yeoman who, as part of his feudal obligations, acts as ‘law man’ for a settlement. He polices the settlement and can levy fines. Beadles are expected to intervene if there is any trouble. If the trouble is serious, they are likely to raise a ‘hue and cry.’ Gathering other villagers to help and bear witness.</dd>\n<dt>Constable</dt>\n<dd>Like a bailiff, a constable is a manager for an absent owner. A constable, however, administers a keep and a large number of manors. In terms of land under his control, a constable is the equivalent of a baron. Unlike barons, however, constables are appointed (and can be dismissed) by their employer, usually an earl.</dd>\n<dt>Ebasethe</dt>\n<dd>A priest, or priestess of Peoni, the kindest and most gentle of the gods. Among her many titles, Peoni is the Guardian of the Meek, Lady of Industrious Labours and the Ripe Harvest, and Lady of Truth.</dd>\n<dt>Fiefholder</dt>\n<dd>A noble who holds a manor from a liege lord. In Asolade Hundred all of the landholding clans hold their fiefs from Sir Troda Dariune, Earl of Balim and Exchequer Royal through his local representative, the constable of Jedes.</dd>\n<dt>Guildsman</dt>\n<dd>A member of one of the many Hârnic guilds. Guildsmen are the experts in their particular field. They are also the only ones legally entitled to practice their profession.</dd>\n<dt>Hundred</dt>\n<dd>Shires (see below) are sub-divided into a number of smaller administrative areas called hundreds, administered by a Bailiff of the Hundred, an official responsible for law and taxes within the hundred and answerable to the local sheriff.</dd>\n<dt>Matakea</dt>\n<dd>A priest, or priestess, of Larani: the benevolent goddess of chivalry and battle and the relucnant warrior. Some noble households keep a Chaplain, a ‘personal’ Matakea to look after the spiritual needs of their household. This is especially common in areas (like Asolade Hundred) where there are few, if any, temples to the Goddess.</dd>\n<dt>Promissory Note</dt>\n<dd>A form of bill of exchange currently in widespread use throughout Hârn. There are two types of promissory notes; a ‘bearer’s note’ and a ‘personal note.’ A ‘bearer’s note’ can be cashed by anyone in possession of it; whereas a ‘personal note’ may only be cashed by the person named or his legally appointed representative.</dd>\n<dt>Shire</dt>\n<dd>A shire is a judicial division of the kingdom. Unrelated to feudal subinfeudination, most barons and earls find that their lands fall under the jurisdiction of several sheriffs. Sherif are royal officials, appointed by the king. They are responsible for royal justice, and the collection of taxes within their shire.</dd>\n<dt>Taburi</dt>\n<dd>A slender dagger, usually without a hilt, designed for throwing.</dd>\n<dt>Villein/Half Villein/Cottar</dt>\n<dd>A tenant of the local Lord. These people are tied to the land. They farm their land in exchange for labour given to their liege lord. The designation depends upon the amount of land farmed.</dd>\n<dd>Villeins hold the most land, over twenty acres; cottars the least, five acres or less. They may not leave their land, or even marry, without the permission of their lord. However, they work his fields and are a valued asset. They are entitled to their lord’s protection, and usually receive it.</dd>\n<dt>Yeoman</dt>\n<dd>A free man (or woman) entitled to bear arms and trained to fight. A yeoman is a farmer who provides military service in exchange for his land.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>WEAPONS</h2>\n<p>On Hârn, the use of certain weapons is restricted to the nobility. The pregenerated characters all carry weapons suitable to their rank. Also, the usual assumption is that people carrying several weapons may be out to cause trouble.</p>\n<p>It would be an unusual (or very trusting) noble who allowed well armed, unknown, individuals into his presence. Daggers are acceptable, but larger weapons are unnecessary and show a poor grasp of etiquette. An attempt to retain weapons when a guest in someone else’s home is a very suspicious act. In Jedes Keep, all weapons, other than daggers, will be stored safely in the barracks and returned to characters when they leave.</p>\n<p>For those new to Hârn the encounter on these pages (parting player characters from their weapons) may make, or break, the scenario as written. Anyone who refuses to hand over their weapons will simply not be employed.</p>\n<p>Referees can, of course, alter this to fit with the prejudices of their players.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>SKILL ROLLS</h2>\n<p>HârnMaster Skill rolls are percentage rolls, based on the character’s skill mastery level. Mastery Levels (ML) for the pregenerated characters are given on the character sheets. There are four possible results, from best to worst they are:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Result</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Critical Failure (CF)</td>\n<td>Any roll above the ML which ends in a 5 or 0 is a CF.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Marginal Failure (MS)</td>\n<td>Any roll above the ML which is not a CF is a MS.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Marginal Success (MS)</td>\n<td>Any roll below the ML which is not a CS is a MS.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Critical Success (CS)</td>\n<td>Any roll below the ML which ends in a 5 or 0 is a CS.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Example: Lysha has an Awareness skill of 44. A roll of 40 is a CS, a roll of 44 is a MS, a roll of 45 is a CF a roll of 48 is a MF.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Skill Index (SI)</h2>\n<p>A characters Skill Index (SI) is the ‘tens’ part of a skill, it is often used as a modifier to other skills. In the example above Lysha’s Awareness skill is 44 so her SI is 4.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GQFkK1Ng8wDWHlCC":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.XVSUEXpbXyr4CfTr"}},"_id":"ZyFN2HKpAWHqSNyJ"}

{"_id":"lKN70nBYEFtw4zml","name":"Part Two: Employment","content":"<h2>The Great Hall</h2>\n<p>The staircase from the small hall leads up through the western wall of the keep. At the top of the stairs is an archway which leads into the south western corner of the great hall. The great hall of Jedes Keep is one of the finest in the kingdom. Forty feet wide and over sixty feet long, it is always occupied.</p>\n<p>The room is cool, hardly warmer than the temperature outside. At the far end of the hall, in front of three windows in a semi-circular wall, there are three trestle tables. Three middle aged men and an older woman sit at the tables. Standing opposite them is a portly, middle aged man with a long grey beard. He is dressed in a bright scarlet cloak, trimmed with yellow and embroidered with yellow stars.</p>\n<p><em>‘We’ll wait here’ </em>Straken tells the characters. As the characters watch, one of the men seated at the table, the constable, judging by the ornate chair he sits in, leans forward and speaks to the man in the scarlet cloak; who turns round and looks at Straken and the characters. He then turns back to the table and makes a low and flamboyant bow, then turns and walks towards the characters. The man sitting at the end of the table, a worried looking man in his late thirties, with thinning red hair, stands and also walks towards the characters. As the scarlet cloaked man approaches he smiles broadly at the characters, and speaks.</p>\n<p><em>‘Greetings, I am Rhondoman the Red, Illusionist, prestidigitator and purveyor of wonders collected from across Lythia. Tell your friends, tell your families, tell everyone. Rhondoman’s Circus and menagerie will be open for business tomorrow.’ </em>He then turns to Straken and says, <em>‘Lead on, my good man.’</em></p>\n<p>As Straken turns to lead the circus master down the stairs, the red haired man approaches the characters and clears his throat. <em>‘Er, I am Sir Tamys Poulty, Chamberlain to the Constable, your names?’</em> Once the players have introduced themselves, Sir Tamys says, <em>‘you may approach.’</em> He then turns and leads the characters towards the table. The three seated figures watch the characters closely as the approach the table. Sir Tamys motions the characters to stand in front of the table, facing the seated nobles, he then introduces the characters by name to the seated nobles.</p>\n<p>The man sitting centrally at the table looks carefully along the line of characters facing him, <em>‘I am Sir Shernath Mirdarne, Constable of Jedes,’</em> he states simply and softly.</p>\n<p>If the Peonian Ebasethe, Ryssi of Chert is not one of the player characters, and if the characters did not escort her to the keep, she will be standing directly behind the nobles, having already delivered her message (see @Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.vi6RpnNGzp9YkSg7]{Letter to Sir Kodar} and @Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.a72OYFtohW8pcsq0]{The Prophecy}). If she is one of the characters, Sir Shernath will speak to her first. <em>‘Ebasethe, I understand that you have a message for me.’ </em>He will take the message and read it carefully. He will ask <em>‘who broke the seal?’ </em>(It was the acting sheriff, if the player has forgotten.) He will then ask <em>‘Have you read this?’</em> while passing the message to the elderly woman sitting to his right.</p>\n<p>If Ryssi, or any of the characters admit to having read the message, he will ask, <em>‘so, what do you make of it?’</em> He will listen attentively to any reply, but will be noncommital about the message.</p>\n<p>‘<em>Melbrin Straken tells me that you are looking for work’</em>, Sir Shernath continues. He waits for a reply, hopefully in the affirmative. <em>‘Your names?’</em> Sir Shernath asks, he then waits for the characters to introduce themselves.</p>\n<p>Sir Shernath will question the characters about their backgrounds. If the pre-generated characters are being used, they will soon discover that Sir Shernath has a prodigious memory. While he does not know all of the characters, he knows a little about some of them.</p>\n<section class=\"highlight\">\n<p><strong>THE CHARACTERS</strong></p>\n<p>Sir Shernath’s knowledge of the characters is limited. He knows enough about three of the pregenerated characters to be able to address them directly.</p>\n<p><strong>Kalas of Delsin: </strong><em>‘Your kinsman served us here for several years. I had no complaints about him. Is he well?’</em></p>\n<p><strong>Lysha of Rakath: </strong><em>‘Clan Rakath serve the Lord of Yalen as his yeoman. Would that be your father? Does he approve of your chosen profession?’</em></p>\n<p><strong>Harlin of Kleve: </strong><em>‘You come from a clan of ostlers, do you not? Do you have guild status?’</em></p>\n<p>Sir Shernath does not know the other characters.</p>\n</section>\n<p>After a short conversation with the characters, in which he politely attempts to discover their competence, Sir Shernath will rub his chin thoughtfully, and will speak, slowly and deliberately <em>‘The Sheriff of Osel asked for our aid, which was given freely, despite his apparent disinterest in this hundred.’</em> (Sir Shernath waves the message from Ryssi as if to demonstrate this point, but does not expand on this remark. This is likely to puzzle anyone who has not read the prophecy.) <em>‘No doubt that you have seen the circus, you’ve certainly seen the circus master.’</em> He pauses,<em> ‘I will require a few guards to patrol the marketplace and fairground. I currently have very few to spare for this task.’</em></p>\n<p>Sir Shernath looks carefully at the characters. <em>‘I can offer employment for a tenday. After that, I will review the situation. If you excel at your duties, you will find that I always have work fo resourceful, competent, and discrete individuals.’</em></p>\n<p>Sir Shernath again pauses, <em>‘If you accept this offer, you will be in my service, you will be acting on my behalf. I will not countenance bullying or bribe taking. You will keep the peace in my demesne, no more, no less. Payment will be ten pence each, for the ten days work. In addition, you will be fed, and quartered, in my halls, you will report to the Melbrin, Straken.’</em> He nods towards the sergeant at arms, who has returned quietly to the hall and is standing behind the characters. <em>‘In extremis, you may report to my herald, Sir Jassyff Mazerony.’</em> He motions towards the gaunt, weatherbeaten man sitting to his left. <em>‘Do you accept these conditions?’</em></p>\n<p>Any questions the characters have about wages, food and lodging will be answered by Sir Jassyff, rather than Sir Shernath (see sidebar).</p>\n<p>Hopefully, the characters will accept Sir Shernath’s terms, for if they don’t this is likely to be a short scenario.</p>\n<p>Assuming that the players accept, they will be put to work immediately. Straken will take the players down to the small hall and issue them with a tabard (a short surcoat). It is of undyed linen and bears the constables crest, the helm &amp; thistle (see page 2). He will then issue their instructions. They are to relieve the village Beadle, Orbil of Arlia, who is currently keeping an eye on the circus folk.</p>\n<p>The characters will notice that Dorrin is no longer in the small hall, he has been replaced by a different guard. While they are reclaiming their weapons and adjusting their new tabards, a muddy, barefoot and bedraggled girl of about twelve years runs across across the drawbridge. Seeing Straken she slides to a stop, leaving a trail of mud behind her, and starts talking very quickly.</p>\n<p><em>‘Straken, Blackeye’s just found Felyss. I think she’s dead, you better come ‘n look.’</em></p>\n<p><em>‘Where?’</em> Asks Straken. <em>‘The grove,’ </em>she replies.</p>\n<p>Straken turns to the characters, <em>‘go with her, and keep your eyes open.’</em> Straken commands. <em>‘I’ll let Sir Jassyff know what’s happened. We’ll get there as soon as we can.’</em> (See @Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.Q8kaYTEDjnyEAzyo]{Yma the Goose Girl})</p>\n<section class=\"highlight\">\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>\n<p>If the Peonian priestess Ryssi is not one of the player characters, Straken will ask the characters to take the priestess with them.</p>\n</section>\n<p>Straken then turns to the new guard. <em>‘Hellard, assemble the manus, then wait here for instructions,’</em> orders Straken. He then turns back to the girl. <em>‘Yma, you take these folks to see Felyss.’</em> The girl looks curiously at the characters, then shrugs. <em>‘Come on then,’</em> she says, and scampers back over the drawbridge.</p>\n<p>Once over the drawbridge Yma turns left and back on herself and half runs, half slides down the grass and into the moat. The water in the moat is about 18”deep and is very cold. Yma then wades under the drawbridge, across the brook, skirting the marsh and beckoning the characters to follow, leads the way into the trees on the opposite side of the Whittle Brook to the keep.</p>\n<table><caption>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold\">Skill Roll: Jumping</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Each player may make a Jumping Roll to leap the brook. Jumping distance is based on character height. Because of the height advantage by taking a running jump from the wall, all of the pre-generated characters could make the jump across the brook.</p>\n</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width:5em\">Result</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:5em;text-align:center\">CF</td>\n<td>Face down in the water, covered in mud and soaked to the skin..</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:5em;text-align:center\">MF</td>\n<td>Lands in the water, feet and legs are wet.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:5em;text-align:center\">MS</td>\n<td>Success, put hands down, to keep balance.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:5em;text-align:center\">CS</td>\n<td>Perfect &amp; graceful landing.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The Whittle Brook is some 12’ wide at the point where it runs past the keep. There is a stone wall running down from the mill to the moat. This wall stands about 6’ above the brook. It is retaining the castle field, from the stream. The wall is low next to the moat. Characters who don’t want to get their feet wet may want to try to jump the brook, or they may simply choose to go the long way round, over the bridge. The former will require a jump roll. The latter will result in a delay in catching up to Yma, it is almost 1000 feet longer than wading the brook.</p>\n<p>As she walks into the woods, Yma slows noticeably. If there is a female character, Yma will take her hand. As she slows down, Yma will whisper, <em>’she’s just in there.’</em> And will point into a large clearing in the woods.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GQFkK1Ng8wDWHlCC":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.CDlyHp0FjySJP3MT"}}}
{"name":"The Urnelt/Kyngen Feud","content":"<p>Relations between three Jedes clans, Ornelt, Urnelt and Kyngen are complicated.</p>\n<h3>Clan Ornelt</h3>\n<p>All members of this clan now living in Jedes are decended from Caerah of Ornelt. His two sons, Tornyn (the senior) [Jedes 41] and Goris [Jedes 37] between then are father, or grandfather to all other members of the clan in Jedes. The clan includes both yeomen and freemen. They take no side in the feud. Caerah also had a brother, Rothlar, a wild and impetuous young man.</p>\n<h3>Clan Urnelt</h3>\n<p>Sendalyn of Urnelt is head of this clan. His father was Rolthar of Ornelt, brother of Caerah (above). His mother was a woman named Mildred of Uratt. Unfortunately, Mildred was married to Gunart of Kyngen, not to Sendalyn’s father. Within a few weeks of his birth, Sendalyn’s parents were both murdered. The murderer was not the cuckolded husband, Gunart, but Gunart’s brother Mordek. Gunart, a devout Peonian, was horrified by his brother’s actions. He severed all ties with his clan and raised Sendalyn as his own son, giving the boy the clan name of Urnelt, a mix of the clan names of both of his parents.</p>\n<p>Sendalyn’s daughter, the merchantyler Cyrael, is supposed to look very like her murdered grandmother, Mildred. Now a free woman she is not close to he father. She rarely speaks to him, and regards his feud as bad for her business.</p>\n<h3>Clan Kyngen</h3>\n<p>Sholas of Kyngen is head of this clan. His father, Mordek of Kyngen, was hanged for murder when Sholas was six years old. Sholas was raised by his mother. While there is little doubt that Mordek was guilty of the murder, Sholas blames the events on his aunt’s infidelity and hates ‘that bastard’ Sendalyn as the cause of his fathers death.</p>\n<h3>The Feud</h3>\n<p>Gunart of Kyngen died twenty years ago. By that time, his adopted son Sendalyn of Urnelt had been subjected to years of taunts by Sholas of Kyngen. Sendalyn has suffered from the hatred of Sholas of Kyngen all of his life. For years he tried to make peace, but the complaints and attacks never stopped. Eventually, he decided that attacking Sholas in the local court was the best solution. The men have each been registering complaints about the other since Gunart died.</p>\n<p>The two men hate each other. Sholas is the son of a murderer, Sendalyn, the bastard whose birth caused the murder. The two men have, in the main, been unable to persuade their offspring to continue the feud. In fact Sendalyn’s daughter is married to Sholas’ son. When the men die, their feud will likely die with them. But, until then, each will take every opportunity to make trouble for the other. The punitive fines the constable levies on both men for ‘mischief making’ have failed to do anything other than generate income for the constable while impoverishing the two clans.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GQFkK1Ng8wDWHlCC":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.KT6RgriELSWEm78d"}},"_id":"mzlcEEDgROjjhbrt"}
{"name":"Denouement","content":"<p>The scenario should end with the characters figuring out that Larith and Corik were in fact responsible for Felyss’ death. Corik was the one who did the actual killing. There are many different ways to resolve the final scenes: five possibilities are given below:</p>\n<h3>It was Him!</h3>\n<p>Larith betrays Corik. <em>‘He’s the one that threw the knife, he’s the one who she attacked, he’s the one you want!’</em> Corik throws a knife at someone (anyone) and tries to make a run for it. The players, or the hue and cry, can bring him down easily (a good archer may even fell him). He is carried off to the keep and thrown into the oubliette to await trial. If Corik implicates Larith too, (which is very likely) the constable will at least bind over the animal handler, preventing him from leaving the hundred. The actual murderer is the one that the constable is interested in. Larith will claim he had simply followed Corik, because he suspected that he was up to no good. Provided that the money is recovered the constable may be lenient with Larith, though he if he is, he will insist that the circus master pays weregeld to Felyss’ family.</p>\n<h3>Flight</h3>\n<p>Larith and Corik realise that the game is up, so they make a run for it. The players can raise the hue and cry, A shout of <em>‘stop, murderers,’</em> or <em>‘stop thief ’</em> will bring out most locals who will enthusiastically join in the chase. Felyss was a popular young woman and, if caught, the two men will receive a ‘damn good kicking’ from the angry locals. Of course, the characters may simply give chase themselves, or they may be forced to rescue the suspects from an angry mob.</p>\n<h3>Fight and Flight</h3>\n<p>Larith and Corik attack the characters and then attempt to flee. This is only likely if there are only two or three characters (possibly four if one or two are ‘mere’ women). Their goal is flight, and if they manage to ‘down’ the characters they won’t stop to finish them off, but will simply grab the loot and run.</p>\n<h3>You’ll never take me alive!</h3>\n<p>Larith is an animal trainer, he controls a large, angry, and very unfriendly bear. At the first sign of trouble, Larith sets the bear onto the characters in order to affect an escape. Provided that the characters are distracted, Larith and Corik will flee, otherwise, they too will attack the characters. This is a ‘big fight’ finale, the type loved by many gamers.</p>\n<h3>No, It was Him!</h3>\n<p>For those who like an even more complicated plot! Larith and Corik realise the game is up, so they attack and kill Modin, the circus’ gentle and simple-minded labourer. They claim that he had attacked them, because they realised that he was the murderer. They’ll claim to have noticed that he was missing, and went looking for him, meeting him coming out of the woods with a sack of coins. They’ll go so far as to plant half of the loot in his belongings. This will add another level of complication to the investigation. If the players can break down this story, this could even lead back to one of the other finales.</p>\n<h2>WHAT HAPPENED?</h2>\n<p>Meliren is a journeyman ostler, better, he is a journeyman ostler from Jedes. He is confident that he will be able to find work anywhere on Hârn. This morning, he stole a promissory note for £1 (240d) from his father and took it to Cyrael of Urnelt. Cyrael cashed the note (at considerable profit to herself). Suspicious, she demanded a commission of 40d. When Meliren agreed, she realised that she was dealing with a desperate young man, who had probably stolen the note from his father. She gave Meliren 200d in coin. Meliren received the money in four tied cloth bags. Three bags each contained sixty pence (an amount known to some usurers as a crown). The fourth bag contained twenty pence. Cyrael had received much of the cash from last years horse fair and chose to further increase her profit on the deal by offloading some foreign currency to the desperate young man. One of the crown bags held nothing but Thardic pennies, the other two contained about half Thardic pennies and half Kaldoric pennies.</p>\n<p>Meliren and Felyss had made a plan over a month ago, and had agreed that they would implement it when an opportunity arose. Both knew that pursuit would be inevitable, but the sudden departure of the light horse troop from Jedes significantly reduced the likely number of pursuers. For this reason, today was the day. After cashing the promissory note Meliren walked along the River Road, the long way home. Felyss was watching, waiting for him to pass her home. Without breaking stride, he passed her one sack of coins through the window. This exchange was witnessed by Valeran of Nidd, who was well behind Meliren, carrying a basket of laundry to the brook. Felyss hid the coins under her mattress. This cash was meant to be payment to her family for her loss. As a serf, Felyss’ parents would have been fined had she absconded. Neither Meliren nor Felyss wanted to cause her family any hardship. The bag of coins in Felyss dwelling contains 36d in Kaldoric coins and 24d from the Coranan Mint in the Thardic Republic. Felyss then slipped out of the cottage. She was just behind Valeran when she left home for the last time. She stopped at the well, to allow Valeran to get further ahead.</p>\n<p>Meliren walked to the bridge over the Whittle Brook, heading for its’ north side, he dropped down into the mill race and hung the remaining coins on a nail on one of the bridge beams. Nervous and incautious, Meliren was not as discrete as he should have been and his actions were witnessed by four people: Valeran, who was just passing the well about 100 yards behind Meliren; Mala, who was already washing clothes in the brook, Corik, who was urinating into the brook about 30 yards upstream from where Mala was washing; and Larith, who had been sent to the well for water. Meliren then returned to his father’s stables, and asked if he could take Hirin, the finest horse in the stables, out for exercise. His father was in a bad mood, for one of the horses was lame and the stable lad hadn’t spotted the fact. Meliren was told his help was needed. He spent the next forty minutes helping his father treat the lame horse. Once they had finished, Meliren persuaded his father to let him ride Hirin. Then the rain came, and instead of taking Hirin, Meliren’s father had him doing indoor work, telling him to leave Hirin in the stable until the rain had ended. This further delayed Meliren’s departure.</p>\n<p>Corik headed down towards the bridge to see what Meliren had hidden. However, Mala was watching him, and he saw both Valeran and Felyss walking towards him. There were too many witnesses, so Corik simply turned and walked back towards the well.</p>\n<p>Felyss, who had stopped at the well, continued towards the bridge. She walked past Corik, went to the north side of the bridge, and stopped to look around. Mala and Valeran were discussing the ruffian and not watching the bridge and Corik was walking away from her. She did not notice Larith, watching her from behind the well so she collected the remaining cash, satisfied that any witnesses would have seen her leave the settlement empty handed. She tied the purses to her belt, crossed the bridge and walked down towards the River Kald.</p>\n<p>Corik and Larith had a quick conversation at the well. Both men were convinced that a pretty young girl had been given a large amount of cash under very suspicious circumstances. Larith suggested that they follow the girl. From their viewpoint at the well, the men saw Felyss walking down the west bank of the brook. Cautious about being seen by the washerwomen, they waited at the corner of a building [41] until the women had their backs turned, ran to the bridge and waded across the stream on the Kald (north) side of the bridge, well out of sight. They then followed Felyss down to the river.</p>\n<p>Corik crept through the woods to get behind Felyss, while Larith simply followed the trail into the clearing. When Larith entered the grove, Felyss was frightened, approached by this rough looking stranger. She feared rape, not robbery. She turned to flee and found Corik behind her, she struck him, scratching his face, and fled past him towards the woods. Corik, more on impulse than anything else, threw a knife at her. It caught her just below the shoulder blade and killed her. The men panicked. Corik retrieved his dagger and picked up the two bags of cash. One of the bags had split, spilling its contents (all pennies from the Coranan mint) widely across the ground. Corik began picking up the coins but the men then heard what they thought were voices on the river, (in fact it was geese) and fled the scene through the undergrowth. They hurriedly left the woods, crossed the bridge and returned to the circus several minutes before it began to rain heavily.</p>\n<p>When the rain ended Meliren saddled the horse, Hirin, and went to meet Felyss. He found her corpse. Distraught and panicked, he turned her body over, laid her straight, and placed a posy on her chest. He then quickly looked around for the cash, but other than a half-dozen pennies scattered around the body, it was nowhere to be found. Meliren then remounted and rode west. Having lost both girl and cash Meliren was devastated and frightened. He decided to continue to ride, to clear his head. He took Hirin on a long, circular route, through Yalen, Novelim, Feneven, Bory, Tamorlan and Calsite before arriving back in Jedes about three hours after the body was discovered.</p>\n<h2>AFTERWARDS</h2>\n<p>Hopefully by the end of their first day in Jedes, the characters will have tracked down, and captured, a murderer. When they return to the keep Sir Jassyff and Sir Shernath will congratulate them. The criminal(s) will be thrown into the oubliette (see Jedes page 25) to await trial. Straken will remind the constable that the characters have missed the main meal of the day, due to their diligent investigations. The characters will be shown to their temporary quarters in the light horse barracks. While they are stowing their gear, two of the serving maids will bring a mutton stew, with leeks &amp; turnip, a couple of loaves of bread and the remains of a huge rhubarb and honey pie.</p>\n<p>The players will then be allocated ‘short watches’ over the circus, until dusk. That evening, they will be summoned, by one of the keep guards, for supper in the great hall and will, for the first time, dine with the forty-odd people who make up the residents and staff of Jedes Keep. They will find that they have been placed above the chamber servants, alongside the regular guards.</p>\n<h2>Loose Ends</h2>\n<p>Several minor matters remain unresolved, many of which could cause future friction in Jedes.</p>\n<p>Felyss’ father, Faran, will continue to hold Meliren partly responsible for his daughters death. After all, if the lad hadn’t turned her head with his rash promises, she’d still be here. He will not, however, return the cash left by Meliren. Felyss mother, however, has more sympathy for the heartbroken young man.</p>\n<p>Brod of Heriel is out of pocket, he is angry with his son, for stealing from him, but is furious with Cyrael of Urnelt for short-changing Meliren. Brod will not ask Felyss father for the money, he is not that insensitive. He will, however, confront Cyrael with as many of the Corani mint coins as he has been able to recover, and demand that she give him a one for one exchange for Kaldoric currency. She will, grudgingly do this, but Brod will advise anyone who asks to keep away from ‘that cheating bitch.’</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GQFkK1Ng8wDWHlCC":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.jf6QSmALF8URYfST"}},"_id":"nspBPaeXo2yalDuI"}

This adventure is intended to be used with the background information presented in the <a href=\"https://www.lythia.com/harnworld/settlements/jedes/\">Jedes</a> article. Available for free download from www.Lythia.com.</p>\n<p>This adventure is intended as an introduction to HârnWorld and the HârnMaster role playing game. This module, together with Jedes and a copy of the HârnMaster rules are all that is required to run this scenario. The scenario is designed as a ‘convention’ module and can be played in a single session. In order to facilitate convention play, six pre-generated characters are included. These characters are simply provided in order to allow a quick start-up. It is not, of course, necessary to use them. However referees will note that the pre-generated characters have ‘local’ backgrounds.</p>\n<p>For the residents of this remote backwater in the south west corner of the Kingdom of Kaldor, there are troubled times ahead. There are several forces at work in Asolade Hundred. Many wish ill upon some, or all, citizens. The player characters will have the opportunity to make a name for themselves in the hundred. They may be able to: impress the lords of Asolade; make new friends (and enemies), and to gain fame and fortune.</p>\n<p>Referees should familiarise themselves with the ‘Jedes’ article, available separately as a free download from Lythia.com Most important NPC’s are detailed in the Jedes article.</p>\n<p>Asolade Hundred is a dynamic place. The series of adventures begins in the spring of 720 T.R. All Hârn articles are valid for this date. The scenarios will take the players forward to the winter of the year.</p>\n<h2>HârnMaster</h2>\n<p>Although this scenario is designed for the <a title=\"The HârnMaster System for Foundry VTT\" href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/packages/hm3\">HârnMaster system</a>, and several examples of skill rolls have been included, it would be relatively easy to convert the scenario to another rules system. The skill rolls in the earlier sections could be converted to rolls using similar skills in the game of your choice. From Part Four onwards no skill rolls are suggested. Any combats could easily be done using another system. Use of a system other than HârnMaster will require some work from the referee. As the character background information is systemless it would even be possible to use the pre-generated characters, converted to another system.</p>\n<h2>The Pre-Generated Characters</h2>\n<p>This scenario starts with the assumption that the player characters are arriving in Jedes on 3rd Nuzyael 720 T.R. and that they are looking for honest work. The background sheets for the pre-generated characters give a short history of the characters lives up to their departure for Jedes. These are the equivalent of the pre-game recommended in HârnMaster 3 character creation. Four of the characters have family, and all have friends, within the hundred. However, they are looking for work because their families cannot afford to keep them. Those characters with families in the area are on reasonably good terms with their clan head and could expect some small assistance from their clan. However, referees are reminded that one good turn deserves another and players trying to rely on relatives for support will soon find that they are being asked for help in return.</p>\n<p>There are two sets of links: one for the Journal entry that can be used for any system, and the other for HârnMaster-sepcific character sheets for the characters.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width:8em\">Name</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>System Agnostic Description</th>\n<th>HârnMaster Character Sheet</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Gorrys of Lunn</td>\n<td>Gorrys is a hunter and the son of a leatherworker.

He is not the best in combat and is poorly armoured, but he is literate and is the only pre-generated character with any skill at riding and horsecraft. Harlin has spent the last seven years as an apprentice in the same village as Kalas. He and Kalas are friends. He has taught Kalas to read, in return Kalas has taught him some weapon skills.

She has some tracking skills. Lysha and Gorrys grew up in the same village, he is ‘the boy next door.’ Over the winter, Gorrys was pulled from the Kald by Kalas, assisted by Ryssi.

He is a fairly good combatant and is the best armoured character. Other than the priestess, Ryssi, who helped in a mine rescue where Ondren was trapped, he does not know any of the other characters. He is the group’s outsider.</td>\n<td>@Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.7AV0z3pgNu9RUS4P]{Character: Ondren of Lemra}</td>\n<td>@Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-actors.DFYSaXw0z1uNKK1N]{Ondren of Lemra}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ryssi of Chert</td>\n<td>Ryssi is the only character to know all of the others. As a Peonian Priestess she is a pacifist healer and a negotiator. This makes her an uncommon first choice for many players. Ryssi met Ondren when she was involved in a mine rescue. She helped minister to the villagers of Novelim, where she met Harlin and Kalas. She helped Kalas rescue Gorrys from the river Kald. She knows Lysha least of all.</td>\n<td>@Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.K3u82UXQRSdK8rsQ]{Character: Ryssi of Chert}</td>\n<td>@Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-actors.M7PYHKkV2VrPblFA]{Ryssi of Chert}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Most of the pre-generated characters know at least some of the others. One, the Peonian Ebasethe Ryssi of Chert, knows all of the others by name. Ryssi may become a recurring character in the campaign. She is likely to appear as a NPC if she is not a player character. She can be used to introduce the players to each other.</p>\n<section class=\"highlight\">\n<p><strong>Note</strong></p>\n<p>Ryssi has a message (@Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.vi6RpnNGzp9YkSg7]{Letter to Sir Kodar} and @Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.a72OYFtohW8pcsq0]{The Prophecy}) to deliver to Sir Shernath. The Pelnala at Bromeleon tasked her with delivering the message to the Acting Sheriff at Hutop, Sir Kodar, however, decided not to act on the information himself, but to simply pass it to the Constable at Jedes. This prophecy will provide a background for future adventures in Asolade hundred.</p>\n</section>\n<p>The first scenario is a murder mystery that should be easy to solve. The purpose of this scenario is to introduce the players to Jedes and to meet many of the important people in the town. It should also give the characters an opportunity to impress the constable.</p>\n<h2>Using Other Characters</h2>\n<p>The simplest way to bring other characters into the scenario is to have them acting as escorts for Ryssi of Chert. This will bring the characters together and allow a simple introduction to the constable. It is likely that the character will be new to the area. If they are ‘not from around here,’ they may find that some of the locals side against them.</p>\n<h2>Jedes</h2>\n<p>Jedes is a small settlement, especially in relation to the size of the keep. It is, however, the main market town for the hundred and it is the only location within a day’s walk where many goods can be bought.</p>\n<p>All residents of the hundred have a passing familiarity with Jedes. Most locals only visit on Market Days, or during the annual Horse Fair. At other times, Jedes is a quiet place.</p>\n<p>The walk into Jedes, from any direction, is along a muddy track. The region is just coming to life after winter. There are ox-ploughs in many of the fields around the village. The men leading the beasts and driving the ploughs are turning the rich, dark, valley soil; preparing the ground for the spring planting.</p>\n<p>Some cottage gardens are being dug to prepare for the planting of herbs, vegetables, and dye-plants. In most of the cottages the shutters are wide open, and women are vigorously wielding besoms, brushing the winter’s grime from their homes.</p>\n<p>No matter from which direction the PCs have entered Jedes, Jedes Keep will have been visible to them for quite some time in the distance. The PCs will notice several people stop work and watch them as they walk into the settlement.</p>\n<h2>Outline</h2>\n<p>The following outline should assist you in navigating through this adventure.</p>\n<h3>Background Information</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.ZyFN2HKpAWHqSNyJ]{HârnWorld Information}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.vjpCyeDk2xGGkrXB]{Scenario Information}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.Q8kaYTEDjnyEAzyo]{Yma the Goose Girl}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.WNaMd2AxWtcsOQmT]{GM Map}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.vi6RpnNGzp9YkSg7]{Letter to Sir Kodar}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.a72OYFtohW8pcsq0]{The Prophecy}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.mzlcEEDgROjjhbrt]{The Urnelt/Kyngen Feud}</p>\n<h3>Scenario</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.6iSsBhoexD6IAIlE]{Part One: Arrival}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.lKN70nBYEFtw4zml]{Part Two: Employment}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.SEMdwuEiu4ozinN1]{Part Three: Scene of the Crime}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.r9JS1SGrc7gnmp6V]{Part Four: Investigation}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.GNwS5oyEiNGZ2ABY]{Part Five: At the Circus}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.nspBPaeXo2yalDuI]{Denouement}</p>\n<h3>NPCs</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.q4yRVWQLghErtYnF]{NPC: Straken of Ornelt} - Sergeant at Arms</p>\n<p>@Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.6sJz1O85vPzYXP6p]{NPC: Sir Shernath Mirdarne} - Constable of Jedes</p>\n<p>@Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.JZ3tRpvxiVwki5Wh]{NPC: Lady Helarn Poutry} - The Chancellor</p>\n<p>@Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.WyWXdTcWkESaHULY]{NPC: Sir Tamys Poulty} - The Chamberlain</p>\n<p>@Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.TxGvMTo85vEpnSlH]{NPC: Sir Jasyff Mazerony} - The Herald</p>\n<p> </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GQFkK1Ng8wDWHlCC":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.u8N4sl5eppn0L6UO"}}}

{"_id":"r9JS1SGrc7gnmp6V","name":"Part Four: Investigation","content":"<section class=\"highlight\">\n<p><strong>Where Next?</strong></p>\n<p>The scenario, up to this point, has been fairly linear; with characters being dragged from location to location by various non-player-characters. From this point onwards, the characters are left to their own devices.</p>\n<p>There are several people who the characters may wish to interview, or confront. The main protagonists are listed alongside, together with any information that they may have.</p>\n<p>News of the murder will spread quickly through the settlement.</p>\n</section>\n<p>The locations listed below are some of those that may be visited by the characters. The location number on the Jedes map is given for reference. It is unlikely that the characters will visit all of these locations. In most instances the order in which they are visited is unimportant.</p>\n<section class=\"highlight\">\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Coner of Kleve &amp; Harlin of Kleve</strong></p>\n<p>Coner of Kleve is a second cousin of one of the pre-generated characters, Harlin of Kleve. Coner will greet his cousin, if he is one of the party. The two men have met at clan gatherings and are on good terms with each other, but are not close.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>Coner of Kleve</h2>\n<p><strong>Jedes Map location: 9</strong></p>\n<p>Coner is a busy man, but will make time to speak to the characters. If the characters tell him that they are investigating a murder, he will be surprised, but this will not affect the information he gives them. A brusque, brown haired and well-dressed man, he will answer any questions tersely. If he can make a simple yes or no answer, he will. He can tell the players the following:</p>\n<p>The coins are Thardic, from the Coranan mint.</p>\n<p>He currently does not have any Thardic coins, there is no need for them.</p>\n<p>It’s possible that the circus has some, or even one of the ostlers, though he thinks the latter to be unlikely.</p>\n<p>He knows that Cyrael of Urnelt has some, she tried to offload some of them to him, but he refused. She’d taken them in payment at last year’s horse fair.</p>\n<p>He can also explain the concept of a usurers note, if asked.</p>\n<h2>Cyrael of Urnelt</h2>\n<p><strong>Jedes </strong><strong>Map location: 18</strong></p>\n<p>Cyrael is a gossip and will ask more questions than she answers. She will want to know who the characters are, where the light horse troop have gone, and what is going on at the keep. When asked about the coins, she will be surprised, and will ask why the characters want to know.</p>\n<p>If the players speak to her soon after the murder, and do not tell her why she is being questioned, she will assume that Meliren of Heriel was working for his father when he cashed the promissory note. She will admit that she gave Meliren the coins in exchange for a promissory note. She will be defensive, claiming that it was an error that she gave Meliren Thardic coins rather than Kaldoric. However, that’s his fault, he should have checked the coins. Now that the deal is done there can be no recompense.</p>\n<p>If the characters tell her that they are investigating a murder, or if the tale of Felyss’ death has already spread around Jedes (GM discretion) Cyrael will want to know everything. Who is dead? How did they die? Who did it? Why do the characters need to know about the coins? If the characters answer her questions, Cyrael will deny all knowledge of the coins, sensing the possibility of making more money from Clan Heriel for her silence. Even if faced with Coner’s statement she will deny selling any coins to anyone. She will only tell her tale if threatened with arrest, or being taken to the constable. Threats of violence will simply make her angry, and she will ask the characters to leave before she reports them to the constable.</p>\n<h2>The Victim’s Family</h2>\n<p><strong>Jedes </strong><strong>Map location: 47</strong></p>\n<p>Felyss’ mother is inconsolable in her grief. If the characters accompany Straken, the house will be empty but for Maryss. If they wait, Faran and Sholas will have returned from the fields and many of the local mothers will be arriving to support the grieving mother. It will be impossible for the characters to get any sense from Maryss of Kyngen.</p>\n<p>Felyss’ father is grieving quietly. He wants the murderer brought to justice. He suspects Meliren of Heriel. His daughter was in love with Meliren and, like many fathers, he firmly believes that the feckless youth was no match for his daughter, despite his status. He will urge the characters to find Meliren quickly. If pressed, however, he will admit that the boy seemed to care deeply for his daughter.</p>\n<p>Felyss had not been missed by her parents, she left before the rain, telling them that she was going to gather dropwood with her friend Brygeth of Gwyfid [Jedes 42].</p>\n<p>Felyss grandfather, Sholas, disagrees with his son. He is convinced that the culprit is Sendalyn of Urnelt, and he’s going to sort the bastard out, once and for all! Unless the characters can talk Sholas round, he will leave the cottage and will head off to confront Sendalyn of Urnelt. If the characters do not try to calm Sholas down, they may be dragged into the ensuing conflict: a fist fight between two elderly grandfathers. Sholas has of course, no evidence for his claim, other than his certainty that Sendalyn is a bad ‘un and has always been a bad ‘un.</p>\n<h2>One Red Herring</h2>\n<p><strong>Jedes </strong><strong>Map location: 28</strong></p>\n<p>This scene is an opportunity for players to use either diplomacy or force. Woe betide any character who draws a weapon, the locals and the constable will regard this as an excessive way to deal with two old men. Talking is unlikely to calm the situation, of course good role-playing, or a Critical Success on a Rhetoric roll may be successful in stopping the fight. Simply pulling the two men apart will stop the physical violence. Each may throw a half-hearted punch at anyone intervening, but neither is foolish enough to attack a fit youngster. Though both will continue to swear and curse everyone, including the characters.</p>\n<p>When things have calmed down, it will quickly become apparent that Sendalyn had nothing to do with the crime: he was working in the fields with dozens of witnesses.</p>\n<h2>A Second Red Herring</h2>\n<p><strong>Jedes </strong><strong>Map location: 42</strong></p>\n<p>Felyss told her parents that she was going to collect dropwood with her friend Brygeth of Gwyfid. Brygeth is a well-built sixteen year old with long black hair. She was Felyss’ closest friend and confidante. Her story will vary, depending upon whether or not she knows that Felyss is dead.</p>\n<p>If she does not know Felyss is dead, she will claim that she had intended to go with Felyss, but had forgotten about it. She’ll ask if her parents are worried, and suggest that it is much too soon to be concerned at her absence.</p>\n<p>When told that Felyss is dead, she’ll tell all. She knows that Felyss and Meliren intended to elope. Meliren was going to get some cash from his father, somehow, and the two were going to run away. Brygeth will not believe that Meliren had anything to do with Felyss’ death.</p>\n<h2>The Boyfriend’s Family</h2>\n<p><strong>Jedes </strong><strong>Map location: 29</strong></p>\n<p>Brod of Heriel is a very important man. He is, as he will tell the characters, a master ostler. Brod will admit that his son Meliren is not at home. He will tell the characters that Meliren has taken one of the horses for exercise and will assure them that he’ll be back well before dusk. If asked about the coins, he knows nothing. However, if the players ask him about the promissory note cashed by Cyrael, he will be surprised, and will go to check his strongbox. He will return, obviously shaken. He will, however, refuse to implicate his son and will simply continue to tell the characters that nothing is missing, all is well, and that his son will return soon.</p>\n<p>Brod will tell the characters that Meliren went out early in the morning, but wasn’t out long. When he came back Meliren asked his father if he could take Hirin (a horse) out for some exercise. Brod made him work first, then the rain came. When the rain stopped, Meliren went off on Hirin.</p>\n<p>Meliren’s mother will be a little more forthcoming. She will tell the characters that Meliren and Felyss wanted to marry, but that her husband would have none of it. She suspects that the couple intended to run away together but will defend her son to the last. Meliren would never harm anyone, certainly not Felyss, whom he loved deeply. If the characters accuse Meliren she will get angry, and will ask them to leave her house. She will tell the characters that they are wasting their time searching for her son, and that they should look elsewhere for the culprit.</p>\n<h2>The Hideworker</h2>\n<p><strong>Jedes </strong><strong>Map location: 1</strong></p>\n<p>Laldyne and her staff have been indoors all day scraping hides. None of them have seen, or heard anything. The stench coming from the leatherworkers cottage is overpowering. Of the pre-generated characters, Gorrys is used to the smell. Laldyne will recognise him. <em>‘You’re Halyr’s eldest aren’t you? What are you doing wearing the constables colour’s?’</em></p>\n<h2>The Ratter</h2>\n<p><strong>Jedes </strong><strong>Map location: 2</strong></p>\n<p>Hectur was working in his vegetable plot until the rain started. He will squint at the characters and ask who they are and what they want before answering any questions. At best he will be surly and rude. If offended he will simply say, ‘I mind my own business’ and give no useful information. With patience the characters may be able to glean a little information from him. Hectur has very poor eyesight, though he won’t admit this. Before the rain his dogs started barking, when he looked up he saw a couple of people walking past his house. If pressed for a description he’ll simply say,<em> ‘a man &amp; a woman.’ </em>He will also remember that, after the rain, a horse and rider passed by, it was a big horse.</p>\n<p>If the pregenerated characters are being used Hectur will also remember four of them (or however many are being used) walking past. It will soon become obvious that he does not recognise the characters as the people he saw. He will describe four young lads, three of them carrying spears. (The four being Gorrys, Harlin, Kalas and Lysha – Lysha being the only one without a spear.)</p>\n<h2>The Yeoman</h2>\n<p><strong>Jedes </strong><strong>Map location: 41</strong></p>\n<p>The building on the corner, next to the bridge, is the home of the yeoman Tornyn of Ornelt (brother of Straken) but he is not at home. His wife will tell the characters that he’s ploughing the top field with the help of both his father and his son and won’t be back until dusk. She is harassed and does not pay much attention to the characters. Her daughter is feverish and she has spent the day nursing them. She was been given herbs by Father Hamnis days ago and it seems that, at last, the fever has broken. She has seen nothing and does not even know that there is a circus in town.</p>\n<h2>The Beadle</h2>\n<p><strong>Jedes </strong><strong>Map location: 6</strong></p>\n<p>Orbil of Arlia will probably be still standing in the field, watching the circus troupe working. He speaks slowly and carefully. He has worked for the constable for many years and he knows that the constable values accuracy over speed. He will greet the characters hopefully, asking them if they’ve been sent to relieve him.</p>\n<p>If asked about Felyss, he did not see her. If asked about Meliren, he will remember seeing ‘the lad’ ride out, not long after the rain finished.</p>\n<p>If asked about the circus folk, he’ll say that most of them have been here most of the time, a couple of them went over to the stream, probably to take a leak. He will initially be very vague, almost dismissive of the questions.</p>\n<p>If closely questioned about the circus folk Orbil will pause, stroke his beard thoughtfully, and give the characters the following information.</p>\n<p>One (or maybe two?) of the men went over to the stream before the rain, and a couple went over afterwards too. They were different men, He can’t remember exactly who went, or when. One of the men went over to the well, before the rain and one of the women went up to the mill, she came back with some loaves. When the rain started the circus folk all ran to one of the wagons, took shelter, and ate. He’ll add:</p>\n<p><em>‘They gave me bread, which I ate, and offered me shelter, but I stayed right here on guard, as ordered.’</em></p>\n<h3>The Washerwomen</h3>\n<p>If the players have been paying attention, they may remember that, when they entered the village, two women were washing clothes by the Whittle Brook. Anyone in the town will be able to identify the women as Valeran of Nidd and Mala of Barlis they will also be able to point out their homes to the characters. The women are easy to find, both are at home. Valeran is hanging the laundry from her windows. Mala is in her garden with her daughter-in-law, carefully pouring water into a bucket of ash and collecting the resulting liquid as it runs out through a hole in the base of the bucket.</p>\n<h2>Valeran of Nidd</h2>\n<p><strong>Jedes </strong><strong>Map location: 23</strong></p>\n<p>Valeran will bemoan her lot and complain loudly about her lazy goodfor nothing husband, while telling the characters what she saw.</p>\n<p>Valeran saw Meliren leave Cyrael’s house. She followed him down the River Road and also saw him pass something to Felyss, as he passed her window. She then saw Meliren walk to the bridge, drop down to the north side, and come back up again. She heard Felyss behind her, but the girl stopped at the well.</p>\n<p>If asked, she will remember seeing a stranger, one of the circus folk, a weasel faced little man, come round the corner as she approached the bridge. She didn’t like the look of him, and Mala, the other washerwoman, was glaring at him. There was also a man at the well when she passed, her description of this man will be very vague, if any of the characters are between 5’8” and 6’0” she’ll point to them and say, <em>‘he was about your height, but thick-set.’</em> If asked, she will say that she thinks that he probably saw Meliren coming out from under the bridge. She will also remember the player characters (if the pre-generated characters are being used). They were near the bridge no more than thirty minutes later.</p>\n<h2>Mala of Barliss</h2>\n<p><strong>Jedes </strong><strong>Map location: 24</strong></p>\n<p>Mala is busy making detergent and cannot stop, so she will be distracted while answering the characters questions. Her story is very similar to the one told by Valeran. She saw Meliren at the bridge, though only briefly, as she was keeping an eye on one of those ne’er-do-wells from the circus. The circus hand was taking a piss, upstream of where she was washing clothes. She gave him a glare (which she will demonstrate) and he walked down towards the River Road. She thought that he was going to go over the bridge, but he saw her watching and turned east. He nearly bumped into Valeran. She’d definitely recognise him again, as she saw him again several minutes before the rain started. He was crossing the bridge, heading east, back towards the circus, he was with another man. She thought that this was odd, as she hadn’t seen either of them cross the bridge in the other direction. She’d probably recognise him too. He was tall and well built and had black hair.</p>\n<h2>The Boyfriend</h2>\n<p>Meliren will arrive home late in the afternoon. He is distraught when he arrives home. He has decided to tell his parents everything, and accept his due punishment. When questioned, he will tell his whole story, refusing to spare himself (see ‘What Happened?‘ @Compendium[hm-adv-sos.sos-journals.nspBPaeXo2yalDuI]{Denouement}). He stole a usurers note from his father and got it cashed by Cyrael of Urnelt. He then gave some of the cash to Felyss, to leave for her parents, and hid the rest for Felyss to collect later. He was supposed to meet her almost straight away, but he was delayed because of his father, and because of the rain. When he got to the meeting place, Felyss was dead, lying sprawled, face down on the ground. He turned her over and straightened her out, kissed her, picked some bluebells for her, and then left. He didn’t know where to go, so he simply rode. Eventually, he realised that he could flee forever, or return to face the consequences of his actions. Here he is.</p>\n<h2>The Bridge</h2>\n<p>Several witnesses saw Meliren, and others, at the bridge over the Whittle Brook. Should the characters decide to examine the bridge, there is little to find. The mill leat (a man made watercourse diverting water to the mill wheel) begins at the bridge. Two simple gates on the upstream side of the bridge control the flow of water down the leat. The bridge itself is simply two spanning beams with a series of decking planks nailed on top.</p>\n<p>Dropping down into the leat on the north (downstream) side of the bridge and looking upstream will reveal nothing.

You will be twenty-one years old this year. You could have been a hideworker, like your father, but the outdoor life called to you. You have been following your Uncle Barth into the woods since your early teens, and have been taught to hunt, track and trap by him.</p>\n<h2>Who are my family?</h2>\n<p>Your father is Halyr of Lunn, Master Hideworker of the village of Yalen. He tans hides and makes shoes, boots and leather clothing. Your father made most of what you wear. Your mother is Lelyn. You have two sisters. Tarissa is nearly nineteen and betrothed to the woodcrafter’s apprentice. Mysha is seventeen, pretty, and shy. You also have two brothers. Rayal is fifteen, unlike you he wanted to follow your father’s profession, he has already left home. As is customary, he has been apprenticed to another hideworker, in the village of Bory. Your youngest brother is Takaryn, he is only seven.</p>\n<h2>Where am I from?</h2>\n<p>You were born and raised in Yalen, in the Hundred of Asolade, in the Shire of Osel, in the Kingdom of Kaldor. Yalen is a small village of only sixteen households, plus the nobles up at the manor. Yalen lies on the south bank of the mighty river Kald. It is a short (30 minute) walk to the town of Jedes. Your family is one of four free families in the village; the others are the woodcrafter, and two yeomen. The remaining residents are peasant farmers; good folk in the main, but tied to the land. The Lord of Yalen Manor is now Sir Alarn Orteyan. He inherited the fief over the winter, on the death of his father, Sir Darnard. You grew up in the village and know everyone by name.</p>\n<h2>Who are my friends?</h2>\n<p>You’ve been friends with Lysha of Rykath since you were both children. Like you she’s the eldest of five children. Lysha is blonde haired and blue eyed and is a few months older than you. Her father is a yeoman; he provides military service to the Lord of Yalen in return for his land. He serves as an archer, using the short forest bow common across the hundred. Lysha has always been a tomboy. Her father thought that she’d grow out of playing yeoman, but she didn’t.</p>\n<p>Lysha has had a scar across her left cheek since she was fifteen. She set off a trap in the woods that flung a sharp flint when triggered; it narrowly missed her eye. Your guilty secret is that you set the trap, though simply as practice, you did not intend to hurt anyone. Fortunately, she doesn’t know that you’re responsible for her scar.</p>\n<p>While out setting snares over the winter you fell into the Kald; you misjudged the edge of the river in the snow. Kalas of Delsin a yeoman from Novelim (the manor of Sir Alarn’s liege, about one league downstream) hauled you out. Wet, freezing, and caught in the middle of a fierce blizzard; he probably saved your life. Kalas and the Peonian Priestess he was escorting, Ryssi of Chert, brought you home. Both Kalas and you spent a month in your fathers house, recuperating. Ryssi and the old monk Flamal, who is now the village priest gave you both healing herbs &amp; infusions. You are indebted to the church for their assistance.</p>\n<h2>What can I do?</h2>\n<p>Over the years you have picked up some skills from your father, you can skin and tan hides, and can sew. But you have learnt most from your uncle. You can forage for food. You know the tracks and spoor of local animals, deer, bear, boar, badger, fox and the like. You can set snares and traps for rabbits, hares, and other small game. You have a little knowledge of local herbs and can make shelter and fire in the woods and forests. You can make and fletch arrows. You are young, fit, and strong willed.</p>\n<h2>What do I own?</h2>\n<p>You own the clothes that you’re wearing: a homespun woollen shirt and leather trousers, calf boots, gauntlets, coat and cowl. Your leather clothing was provided by your father, your gauntlets are pigskin, made from the skin of a young wild boar you killed. The remaining leather garments are all leather from local cattle.</p>\n<p>You own a dagger, a short forest bow, a 6’ spear and a box quiver containing twenty arrows. You have three rabbits, caught, skinned and gutted last night. The flesh and fur can be bartered. A leather pouch tied to your belt contains your monetary wealth, one silver penny, it also contains a flint and steel. A rough canvas sack contains spare clothes, a second shirt and a pair of wool trousers.</p>\n<h2>Where am I going?</h2>\n<p>You helped your uncle for many years. He acted as huntsman and beater for Sir Danard Orteyan. Unfortunately, Sir Danard died over the winter, despite the ministrations of Ryssi of Chert. Shortly after his death, Sir Danard’s son, Sir Alarn summoned both you and your uncle to the manor to tell you that he no longer required your services. Your uncle has since found work in Yeashim, but Sir Yenin Ercamber, the Lord of Yeashim wanted only one hunter. A discussion with your father and uncle has resulted in you leaving Yalen to walk to Jedes, it is the largest settlement for many leagues. There is a market in Jedes four times each month. The next one is tomorrow. It is possible that Kalas, Lysha and Kalas’ friend Harlin will go with you to find work.</p>\n<h2>Religion</h2>\n<p>Most people, including you, worship gentle Peoni, goddess of healing and agriculture. Almost every village has a chapel to the goddess. Her services take place on the 4th, 12th, 20th &amp; 28th of each month. You usually attend the service.</p>\n<p>The nobles worship Larani, goddess of the feudal ideal. She is regarded by many as the protector of Peoni.</p>\n<p>You know a little of any other gods: Halea is the wanton goddess of profit, pleasure and luck, worshipped by some merchants and city dwellers. Ilvir is the mystic &amp; craven lord. A god of the old ways and old times. Morgath, Naveh and Agrik are the dark gods. All are evil, following them will damn your eternal soul.</p>\n<h2>ASOLADE HUNDRED</h2>\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>Asolade Hundred lies in the south-western corner of the Kingdom of Kaldor. The Kald River forms the northeastern boundary, the Osel river, the southern boundary. The western part of the hundred is mostly flat and fertile farmland, although low hills separate the farmland along the Kald from the Osel river valley. Almost all of the population live and work in this half of the hundred.  The twenty-two settlements are mostly manorial villages, similar to your own home village. The largest settlement is Jedes, with its tall and imposing keep. There is a monastery to the south, Bromeleon. Bromeleon is the home of the shrine to St. Bromel and contains a large hospital. The monks also maintain a leper colony nearby. There are two mining settlements in the hills: one, Orofal, mines copper; the other, Tasinald, is a lead mine. The eastern part of the hundred is heavily forested and sparsely populated.</p>\n<p>Across the Kald river to the north dwell the Kath, fiercely territorial forest dwelling nomads. To the north-east lies most of civilised Kaldor. The roads are poor and can be dangerous, but all roads lead to Tashal, the capital, a great city where wise old King Miginath rules. To the east lies Daynora Hundred and Hutop Keep, home of the Sheriff of Osel, keeper of the king’s peace. To the south lies the Oselmarch, and the lands of the Pagaelin, fierce and ruthless barbarians, eaters of children. Everyone knows the stories of their cruelty. To the west lie the forests of Evael, home of the elves. A mysterious people, they are a legend across much of Hârn. Everyone in Asolade knows someone who knows someone who has seen an elf. But no-one can give a good description.</p>\n<h3>Law</h3>\n<p>The manor lords hold court irregularly, they deal with disputes between the serfs in their village. Most of the manor lords owe fealty to Earl Dariune, a mighty lord who lives in a huge castle in far off Kiban. A constable, Sir Shernath Mirdarne, rules Jedes on behalf of the Earl. The constable is a powerful man, able to call upon dozens of knights and men-at-arms. As Earl Dariune’s representative in the Hundred, he can hold court over his vassals.  Sir Shernath has the reputation of being honest and fair in his judgements. Most locals will turn to the vassal’s court rather than take royal justice.</p>\n<p>The representative of Royal Justice within the hundred is the Bailiff of the Hundred, Sir Arrys Maradyne. The hundred court is held in the hundred moot village of Asolade, after which the hundred is named.</p>","img":"modules/hm-adv-sos/assets/images/gorrys-of-lunn.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GQFkK1Ng8wDWHlCC":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.4DwVLjAotn1TRx8K"}},"_id":"sz2RlUb6XSLwbEEl"}

Brygeth was also plagued by visions. She was shunned, even by her fellow unfortunates, because of her unwelcome gift. She has predicted many deaths, most with remarkable accuracy, and several other events, such as Brother Hadyl’s infection with the disease. Until now her sayings have involved only events in Poynter and Bromeleon.</p>\n<p>Ten days ago, however, Brother Hadyl, who now ministers to the lepers, brought to me the sad news of her demise. With this news he also brought information of a final series of predictions. I cannot attest to the accuracy of what follows, it may simply be the ramblings’ of a dying leper. However, given the nature of her final statement, I thought it wise to bring her words to your attention. A transcript of the last prophesy of Brygeth is appended, do with this as you will.</p>\n<p><br />The Blessings of Peoni to you<br />Rablar Oppias, Pelnala,<br />Bromeleon Abbey</p>","img":"modules/hm-adv-sos/assets/images/letter-to-sir-kodar.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GQFkK1Ng8wDWHlCC":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.hrMj7UukEsg1PaE0"}},"_id":"vi6RpnNGzp9YkSg7"}
{"name":"Scenario Information","content":"<h2>Wages</h2>\n<p>Both yeomen and the mercenary (Kalas, Lysha and Ondren) know that the standard wage for a light footman is 24d per month. A penny a day is generous. asking for more will require some negotiation. Referees may require that a rhetoric roll be made. Whether by dice roll or role-play, the best offer the characters will get will be 12d for the ten days work plus a bonus of 3d each for exceptional service. They will be offered 3d in advance.</p>\n<h2>Food</h2>\n<p>There are three meals each day. Breakfast is soon after dawn, residents break their fast with bread and small (weak or watered) beer; plus butter and fruit in season, and in the winter months, oatmeal porridge. The main meal of the day is at, or before noon. It is being prepared while the characters are being interviewed. Servants will be beginning to set up tables and benches in the hall. Supper is a little before dusk.</p>\n<h2>Lodging</h2>\n<p>The characters will be given bunk beds in the bunkroom above the weaponcrafter’s workshop on a temporary basis. These are the quarters of the Light Horse Squadron, who may be away for several days. When the squadron return, the characters will be provided with straw pallets and will be sleep in the main hall with the servants.</p>\n<h2>The Coins</h2>\n<p>It is possible that the characters will decide not to tell anyone about the few silver pennies scattered around the murder scene. They may simply choose to keep them for themselves.</p>\n<p>If they tell Straken about the coins he will realise that foreign coins are a significant clue. If the characters don’t come up with the idea themselves, he will suggest that they speak to the two mercantylers in town, as they are the only locals with any likelihood of having foreign coins.</p>\n<p>If the characters do decide not to tell anyone about the coins, they may find themselves in trouble later, as Thardan coins are rare, and will become associated with the murder as investigations continue.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GQFkK1Ng8wDWHlCC":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.QsFQ9SZ8ESgFe6lQ"}},"_id":"vjpCyeDk2xGGkrXB"}
